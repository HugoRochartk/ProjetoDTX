We see how Kolarov has lost his position, he wins in the back to the Serbian side, who arrives late. And there he finds Volasi square meters to make his own. This is a player who, like Manchester City, does not watch closely. In this type of speed, it is very difficult to stop.

Yes, and he does well because it was a ball that was poisoned and if he tried to block it, it could probably generate a problem, that ball also came with a lot of effect.

As he could, Scott Dunne, ball in the outfield. A game played by Tuatu, from power to power. And from area to area. The game is not centered on the pitch.

We're not just talking about fast players like Navas or players with special technical quality like Agüero. We're talking about players with a brutal physical level. That's why every time the team shows so aggressive in the pressure and so vertical in the exit, it's hard to stop.

And to be fair to Joe Hart, it's such a sweet strike from Victor Moses. He's never getting there with his left hand.

So a positive move in the sense he's bringing on a striker here. Well, it's interesting to see a probably play off the right-hand side, but the ball generally sticks when it's played up to Jelovic. And that's what West Ham need right now, they need to protect the ball better when it's played up to Jelovic. And that's what West Ham need right now. They need to protect the ball better when it is knocked up. First thing he has to do, though, is defend.;whisper-large;Substitution

And he's got the ball. He's got the ball, he's got the ball, he's got the ball, he's got the ball, he's got the ball run the clock down in the corner here. It's an awkward one for him.

Surprised they're not taking the shot, surprised they put the centre-backs up. That one pulled it back to Creswell, who's gone himself into a good position here and then committed the foul. Worst of a corner, wasn't it? It was. Maybe there's going to be quite a bit of stoppage time, but now you have to name your man of the match. I think you could take your pick in that West Ham backline, but for me Winston Reith has been absolutely outstanding.;whisper-large;Corner/Foul
542;england_epl;2015-09-19 - 19-30 Manchester City 1 - 2 West Ham;2668;2700; and Reit has been absolutely outstanding today. Up against one of the best in the business, Sergio Agüero.

Just the one so far, and you wonder whether this is the day when things can really explode for the Spanish international. In the meantime, here's Besic for Everton, but a bit of hesitation from Zouma, who was unable to make the challenge on the Everton midfielder at the ex-council of corner. I think you're right there, Darren in hesitation, all right, Zermak will come in, quite clearly, clearly his line's there, but he just moved back and that message's run at him.

Of course Aaron Lennon was drafted in during the course of the transfer window and Kevin Miralles is among the Everton subs as well today. He was also the the victim of one of the most bizarre dismissals I think I've seen.

Yeah, it's an early ball in Barkley, he really should have dealt better with it, but yeah, Lukaku's just put his elbow into him a little bit, letting him know that he's around and he's going to be physical today. I think that's sometimes a good tactic as well from the centre forward.

Here's Tedrow for Chelsea, now Fabregas quickly to Hazard and then Mikel, now Ivanovic who have got plenty of white waiting for the cross. And Brendan Galloway gets back into his defensive position to make an important challenge on Branislav Ivanovic. Yeah, we see Basic just coming on now and he is. Glenn was right, he's holding his hamstring so it's definitely a win for him.;whisper-large;Ball out of play/Throw-in
550;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;358;390; He's holding his hamstring, so it's definitely a hamstring injury, and I'm astonished to see him on the pitch still. Here's Hazard wiggling away, we hear that Steven Naismith is preparing himself on the far side. Away by Jackie Elka, not very far, now Kono, they're a little bit boxed in here, Everton. And in the end, that's Pillequeta, runs out of room, and Everton get the goal kick, but it was a decent pressure there from Chelsea. Yeah you saw different phases there of Chelsea they looked as if they're at it with the ball and brisk their movements excellent Hazard's coming off these;whisper-large;Ball out of play
551;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;388;420; Excellent, Hazard's coming off these perch, coming in there causing problems, Pedro will do the same. Nevertum have really got to be concentrated defensively. There's Seamus Coleman. So without his usual partner in crime in the other full-back position for the moment, Leighton Baines. Pedro wins it back for Chelsea and then was looking to set Hazard away. Lovely little knock-knock again wasn't it from Padreau there.;whisper-large;Clearance
552;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;448;480; He's beaten Tidy from Everton to get it forward towards Lukaku and then Besic was on his way. Now Barkley, and a wrap-fist through the penalty area without a touch off Ivanovic, and it's the Chelsea goal kick. Well Besic seemed there, Michael, to give one last effort to try and make an impact on that Everton attack. Yeah, and that's why I say I was astonished he's tried to continue the first time, he actually bursts into life again, it goes, and that's a hamstring injury for you this is his initial injury you see there his left leg just almost well it goes out;whisper-large;Shots off target/Ball out of play
553;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;508;540; and beat Chelsea in the Premier League at Goodison Park is the man that's going to be sent on by Roberto Martinez. Slightly different type of player isn't he, Nate Smith-Glenn? Yes, certainly is. He's just going to fill the same role though. He's come out here on the left-hand side. He'll work up and down and Ivanovic is pushing himself way way forward so I think he's gonna have to tighten up and get across and help help the pullback out;whisper-large;Substitution/Clearance
554;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;538;570; the full-back out. As Mikel providing a bit of muscle in central midfield which is what he's been brought in to do today by Jose Mourinho. Chelsea's worst start to a season for 20 years, three defeats already. They only lost four matches in all competitions over the whole of last season, 50 plus games, which illustrates just how out of character this start has been for the defending Barclays Premier League champions. But they started well here and Tedro in particular getting on the ball early. Now Ivanovic and Galloway, not for the first time.;whisper-large;Ball out of play/Throw-in/Ball out of play
555;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;568;600; and Galloway not for the first time across quickly to be in the right place to block the Ivanovich cross he did particularly well there, he just held up play a little bit, Naismith got caught and you see him there he got caught on the other side of the pitch and all of a sudden it was 2 v 1 he just held his ground, held his ground, bought a bit of time, went with the run up, could defend him from the youngster he was the under-21s player of the year last season Brendan Galloway, still only 19, started the first three Premier League matches of the season And they're back in today with Leighton Baines still out. Here's the corner from Pelley;whisper-large;Corner
556;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;598;630; Still out, here's the corner from Tedrow and the defending done this time by McCarthy Back in by Fabregas towards Zouma He was just able to get half a yard in front of Gareth Barry, but couldn't find the right finish As the corner comes in there just one interesting thing at Naismith's Marking Ivanovic, that to me looks like a better one this one I think if Chelsea see that from the bench, Ivanovic gets a signal. They've got to play to him. Great space and let him be 1 v 1 with him because he'll outmatch him.;whisper-large;Ball out of play/Clearance
557;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;658;690; With a real press from Chelsea, hasn't there, early on? Trying to prevent Emerson from playing out from the back, which is what they like to do. Here's Kone. Seamus Coleman's made a really good run forward from right back, but Kone couldn't quite get it out to him, although he will now. Here is Coleman. And there's a morbid for Everton here from McCarthy. And in he goes towards Naysmith, who just tried to ghost out.;whisper-large;Ball out of play
558;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;688;720; Naysmith who just tried to ghost in towards the far post to get in behind Ivanovic. Yeah, it's a good, decent ball in, isn't it? Ivanovic has closed himself off, really. Not really aware of Naysmith, it's inches from him getting in on the back post. But that attack comes from John Stones, not panicking in front of his own penalty area, under pressure from Costa. Football in centre-half, goes inside him and sets up an attack. It was a real goals feast last season when the sides met. 6-3, 2-2.;whisper-large;Clearance
559;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;748;780; brought in by Chelsea during the window. He's not even on the bench today, the young Carnaian International. Here's Petro. Naismith going quickly for Everton. Now Barrett. Lukaku. Didn't fall for Naismith but it will work its way through here to Ross Barkley.;whisper-large;Ball out of play/Throw-in
560;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;838;870; It's nearly done by Barry. Here's Lukaku. McCarthy looking to get it forward slightly quicker this time. Aruna Kone. Ivanovic was always going to be favourite for that one. Lovely quick ball from McCarthy and that's what Everton have got to do. When they can play forward, can they play it forward quickly? Here you see Ivanovic here, already done his defensive duties much better.;whisper-large;Ball out of play
561;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;868;900; defensive duties much better. That's been a question mark about him this season and he looks like he's got a real defensive head on him. That little kick out there wasn't from Neysmith but he did kick the ball first and then just had a little bit of a follow through of Van Vich and I know exactly where he's coming from. Oat's first straight end in the world as one of the defenders, but shielding it out, you can't get past them to get to the ball. Jackie Altrera away.;whisper-large;Clearance
562;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;898;930; How did Chelsea look in midfield for you, Glen? We talked about the balance this morning, we talked about the fact that John-Ovi Mikail's coming alongside Matic, are they slightly more solid in there? Much more solid, Flitsch, much more. Here's Diego Costa, Hazard sends him away, still Diego Costa really good defended by Kozak Jadielka. The kind of chance last season, Michael, that Costa would have gobbled up. Well, I think he was just waiting for the penalty there, I think he was thinking Jagielka was going to make a little contact and then he would go down because it was certainly an area where you think it's going to be a penalty.;whisper-large;Ball out of play/Throw-in
563;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;958;990; And we also saw the benefit there, Gleder McGolki with a decent first touch, that was fizz-backing, wasn't it, to Tim Howard. Here's Galloway. And Naysmith. Good skill to get away from Matic, and then Galloway and Everton are looking on the door here, and Naysmith has come off the fence to score the opening goal against Chelsea, just to add to Jose Mourinho's early season troubles;whisper-large;Shots on target/Goal
564;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1018;1050; Smith, lovely header. That's a great run into the box from Ney Smith, he's played it and he's gone again, but for me, Zouma's sleeping, Zouma's got to get across, he's got to be on the goal side of Ney Smith and he clears that, he's sleeping. Well, it's an early birthday present for Steven Ney Smith, who's 29 on Monday, scored the winner the last time Everton beat Chelsea, and he's got the Merseysiders ahead inside 18 minutes here at Goodison Park and it's another problem to add to the growing list for Jose Mourinho and Chelsea.;whisper-large;Kick-off
565;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1078;1110; lack for confidence do they have a team with the players out from the back? yeah and it stands on the back now, stands from John Stones that calming influence that's what you call an impact off the bench Glenn isn't it? well it is and sometimes you know I don't think Martin Les would have been ever thinking of making that substitution but by injury Rezic has to go off and Neusen has come on and made the difference and he looks dangerous. What I liked about his goal is he played, he didn't stand and watch his good pass, he put himself in the box.;whisper-large;Ball out of play/Throw-in
566;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1108;1140; and watch his good pass, he put himself in the box. Terence Amarini have made the decision before the game to bring back John Terry and pair him with Kurt Zuma today, Gary Cahill is amongst the Chelsea subs today having played for England during the international break. Neither centre-back can do anything about the Steven Ney-Smith header. Here come Everton again with Seamus Coleman, and they've got plenty of blue to pick out as well, in it goes towards Kone! And Ovejkovic's got a fingertip to that, fantastic save!;whisper-large;Shots off target/Ball out of play
567;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1138;1170; Everton so close to a second goal they look so threatening when they come forward. Yeah great save from Begovic but again I thought Coleman was going to swing it in straight away because Everton had the numbers, look at that, three men in the box, not a bad header from Cooney just didn't quite have the power on the cross to get the necessary power. And Barkley somehow gets the short corner back again. Now McCarthy, Everton play with so much confidence and they test short corner back again. McAfee, Everton play with so much confidence and they test Begovic again, who for the second time in quicksand.;whisper-large;Corner/Shots on target/Ball out of play
568;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1168;1200; and for the second time in quick succession, equal to it. Yeah, great spell of football from Everton now, really getting confidence from the goal they've got. Good strike, good save again, Begovic right on good form. Everton can keep the pressure on with the corner, which is delivered in by Barkley this time. Cleared as far as Naismith. Now Barkley. That's Pellecretta and Diego Costa combining to win it back and then Galloway quickly on Pedro. This is looking good.;whisper-large;Corner/Ball out of play
569;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1198;1230; on Pedro but this is looking like a big five minutes or so for Chelsea isn't it Glenn, Everton really have their tails up now. Yeah they've got to show a lot of character it's not just about silky football this is the ball in from Kone, it's a decent header and what a great save, fingertip save, he's half anticipated it but lovely ball from Kongman and that's a decent header, he's hit the target wonderful save but no sir it's a testing time for Chelsea now. This final minute they've got weather, the storm, compose themselves and people even getting into the top four players. Those players up front, there's something going to happen.;whisper-large;Clearance/Foul
570;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1258;1290; From that distance was probably quite frightening for him, but he's got that end, hasn't he? He's got that nasty streak in him, Costa, that's what makes him tick. Maybe looking for something to get him going again as well, he's only got the one goal this season, in fact he's only scored four times in his last 17 Chelsea appearances back towards the end of January, he was so lethal in the early weeks of last season, Costa. Here's Naismith with another one! And that's a double to lead! And what an introduction, Steven Naismith!;whisper-large;Indirect free-kick/Shots on target/Goal
571;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1318;1350; He stands there, you either force him wide or you close him down and he just stands and stands and invites the shot, well, you're gonna do that pick that out the back of the net. Chelsea were so solid as they virtually cruised to the championship last season, Glenn, but they are being ripped apart here by Everton. Well, they are and Mourinho's got a massive problem. He's put Mikel in there and told Macic and Mikel to stay in there and make it nice and tight and they're 2-0 down With 22 minutes gone, so he's got to he's got to do something from the bench here. He's got a look for attacking He's gonna have to change his;whisper-large;Kick-off
572;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1378;1410; Obviously there's been two goals, but it could have been four for Everton already. Chelsea really haven't threatened Everton's back four at all yet. 2-0 scoreline is fully justified. Here's Costa, now Matic. Costa has just left one of the Everton players on the ground. The attack continues with Pedro, he's just popped up on the left-hand side this time, but there's not much on the ground and the attack continues with Pedro, he's just popped up on the left hand side this time but there's not much on the shot and Tim Howen had it covered and Seamus Coleman back on his feet after that collision with Diego;whisper-large;Shots off target/Ball out of play
573;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1408;1440; after that collision with Diego Costa. Well these two have had a little bit of previous haven't they? You just see the flailing arm there of Costa, Flicks Coleman in the face. It's lucky that the referee didn't see that. We talked about the problems, Glenn, that Jose Mourinho's got. What do you do? Put yourself in his position. 24 minutes gone and 2-0 down. What's the next step?;whisper-large;Clearance
574;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1438;1470; and it's gone a 2-0 down, what's the next step? He's got to change the shape in that midfield and go a bit more offensive, you know, it's no good, it's not good hanging on to this result, he's got to get a goal and then build from there, but, you know, they've got the players to do that, but at the moment, they're all over the place. Tex Robe, looking to try playing through towards Fabregas who've made a run from midfield, now Matic. Chelsea have now conceded 11 goals in what is their fifth Premier League match of the season.;whisper-large;Clearance
575;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1468;1500; They've conceded more goals than any other side, Sunderland and Manier are two-nil with 10. Of course, Chelsea have played 24.5 minutes more than them so far, but just not something you associate with the Mourinho side, easy to score on, and that's been the problem in the early weeks of the season for them, and it's very much in evidence here today, Barclay caught there. Goal!;whisper-large;Foul/Indirect free-kick
576;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1528;1560; The kelp. John Terry, and they've worked it nicely here, Chelsea, and they've got options here, and Asbunna Queta might go himself. Well, he did do it, Tim Howard for the first time really called into action and made an important save there for Everton. Yeah, Kone needs to know what he's doing here. He hasn't got a clue where Asbunna Queta is. Takes John Stones to come across and save his mate there.;whisper-large;Shots on target/Ball out of play
577;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1558;1590; It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one.

578;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1618;1650; Gareth Barry in the off-touch role, and the walk-out entree, Marriner stood literally a yard or two away, he gives the free kick and some respite to Chelsea. Another opportunity, though, for Everton. It was, it was, here we see the free kick from Gareth Barry, there's another chance for Everton on the break again. Just moments before that. And it's gone.

580;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1678;1710; Yeah, he's got a foul for his team, you know, he's come over here on the right side, he's been out on the left, through the centre, trying to seek the ball, but just a little bit of a foul there, Jagielka, and they've gone to sleep. There's Ivanovic from the quick free kick, Galloway though, woke up quickly, and then Garraffari, not for the first time, gets in there to win it back for Everton, and here they come again with Naysmith, if he can beat Mikel to it, not this time. The real problem though here for Chelsea, Michael, in transition, when Everton start to break, they're finding so much space and so many opportunities. Yeah, and that's why we say first goals in...;whisper-large;Indirect free-kick
581;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1768;1800; Al-Dari, McCarthy. We're going to get a little bit of frustration maybe there from Ivanovic.;whisper-large;Foul
582;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1798;1830; A bit of frustration maybe there from Ivanovic. Steven Naismith won't mind too much, no two goals already. Yeah, and he was going nowhere, wasn't he? He was probably facing a little bit of trouble, may have had to go back to his goalkeeper, so he was probably delighted to build a little clip from Ivanovic. You look at Chelsea at the moment, last year they were very hard to play against. You didn't want to play against them. They had pressure, they were physical. I think this difference this season is opposition have got time on the ball. I mean that's what they were good at, that it's there. Just as people were arriving on the ball they were closing.;whisper-large;Indirect free-kick
583;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1918;1950; And the block comes in from Naismith and that's a Chelsea corner.

584;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2038;2070; is Kone, a little clip in towards Lukaku and then on towards Nathan, he's on a hat-trick of course the look on Michael's face suggests he's not too convinced about that being a freaking Chelsea player. He's not keen on that at all and Vanovic he's got a reputation for going down too easy, he was lucky there because one day a referee won't buy it and no- another time could have picked the ball up and gone on the attack.;whisper-large;Foul/Indirect free-kick

You can just see the flight of the ball, it's hardly spinning or anything, it's just purely struck from Matic. Thumping finish. He doesn't score many, does he the man in Matic? He got one last season here in the 6-3 win that Chelsea had against Everton but you don't hit them any better than that, Clint.

As Costa comes forward, people were expecting those two to battle for the Championship, City yet to concede a goal in the Premier League so far. Here's Hazard.

Here's the Fabregas corner which is in towards Zouma, away by Kone. It's not been a goal threat so far, Costa, but he's certainly been a physical threat hasn't he, trying to use his size and bulk to disrupt these Edmonton defenders, Michael.

Always important not to get too close to the centre forward in that instance, make sure you can see the ball, get the block on. Chelsea, they're always a danger from the set-piece, and it goes from Fabregas, and this time it was Zouma attacking it, the last touch off Jagielka.;whisper-large;Corner/Ball out of play
599;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2518;2550; I know this time by stones as far as hazard who lines it up the final touch of think came off the van admits the deflection Andre Baron has given the goal kick to Everton but he could have gone anywhere that yeah when you hit it hard and low with that type of power. He's always got a chance of taking a deflection. One thought in his mind, he had to go for it.;whisper-large;Corner/Shots off target/Ball out of play
600;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2548;2580; One thought in his mind then as he walked onto it. Yeah, he steadied himself really well and you feel the pressure's just building up on Everton. Half-time's going to be a good half-time for them. Didn't think we'd be saying that midway through the half, that half-time can't really come soon enough for Roberto Martinez at the moment, but that goal from Matijs has changed things a fair bit. from Matijs, that changed things a fair bit.;whisper-large;Clearance
601;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2608;2640; The flag would have been up against Diego Costa had Tim Howard not been able to deal with it. Yeah, Costa just starting to make those runs in behind now, getting in between the two centre halves, looking to go in behind rather than to feed, and it's a danger. Here's Coleman. Well, Barry. Clips on up towards Kone. So a busy weekend as always after the Champions League in Europa League, Fletcher and Sav were back next Saturday.;whisper-large;Ball out of play
602;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2638;2670; in Europa League, Fletcher and South, we're back next Saturday 10 o'clock live from Stamford Bridge because we've got a cracker for you next week, London Derby Chelsea against Arsenal, Jake and the team from midday, that available on Ultra HD and of course on BT Sport 1 as well, quite a week of football coming up on BT Sport Everton 2, Chelsea 1, final minutes of what's been a riveting first half here at Goodison Park. Here's Diego Costa.;whisper-large;Clearance
603;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2668;2700; Here's Diego Costa. Matic, still going here, Matic and he's looking to tee up Pedro. Alert defending from Jagielka. Now Hazard, Pedro. Pedro with the shot, again it took, well I thought it took a deflection. It's gonna be a goal kick. You see Matic now just starting to get involved a little bit more with Hazard, with Pedro. Just a little bit off balance there.;whisper-large;Shots off target/Ball out of play
604;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;-2;30; after four matches. He has been eight points behind before after four games. It was in his final season at Real Madrid and he went on that season to finish 15 points behind Barcelona. He is a front-runner, notoriously Jose Mourinho, but he's got a different set of problems to deal with at the moment, although there were signs towards the end of the first half with a Matic goal that the tide may be turning.;whisper-large;Kick-off
605;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;28;60; This ball forward in the second half by Mikel, which is away by Seamus Coleman. And it's Aruna Kone, Matic win with a challenge for Chelsea. It's a case of Chelsea possession in the first half and Everton being very effective on the counter-attack Michael particularly for the first half an hour or so. I wonder what the respective managers might have done at half time just to check.;whisper-large;Ball out of play/Throw-in
606;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;118;150; Matic, Matic's first Chelsea goal came on this ground last season, and scored one to remember in the first half here today. There's Darriyih with a challenge on Hazard, he's done that well today, Gareth Barrett. This is 567th appearance in the Premier League today.;whisper-large;Foul
607;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;148;180; in the Premier League today Gareth Barry and Roberto Martinez will be pleased with what he's seen from his midfielder so far. Normally Ryan Giggs, Frank Manfield and David James have played more games in the top flight than Gareth Barry and he's been strong today. Yes, he's closed down exceedingly well and what he does is he closes when people are receiving the ball. Whilst he's still got the energy, as people are receiving it, he's actually down there throwing, getting the heads down, and he's pinched the ball for Everton today. Can he continue it for 90 minutes?;whisper-large;Indirect free-kick/Foul/Indirect free-kick/Ball out of play
608;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;178;210; Little instance off the ball again there, Michael, with Diego Costa, he's not been a stranger to those today. No, well, there was a flailing arm, wasn't there, in the first half, on Coleman, and then there was definitely a little kick-out again there on Naismith, so it's that type of play, he sails close to the wind, doesn't he, and you'd say that he's one of the bankers to get a yellow card. It's Lukaku, Matic was tracking back, but he's so strong isn't he Moukaku when he's on the ball and they're begging the Test to hurry here, because McCarthy was applying the pressure;whisper-large;Ball out of play/Throw-in
609;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;208;240; the pressure. Made those two really important saves didn't he Begovic in the first half when Everton really had their tails up they might be very significant for Chelsea today. Here's Seamus Coleman. McKellen with the challenge but Coleman didn't give it up for Emerton. McCarthy to Naysmith. Naysmith shoots towards Lukaku just reached there by Zouma and then Fabregas just caught by Naysmith as he played it away and that's being brought back for a Chelsea free kick;whisper-large;Shots off target/Foul
610;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;238;270; kick. Yeah just catches him there's Fabregas looking to to feed Costa earlier, gone early, just caught him though as a foul for Chelsea but they've given the ball away again needlessly. A challenge by Zouba on Lukaku, here's Matic. Hazard, Costa.;whisper-large;Indirect free-kick
611;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;268;300; and Hazard again but nobody to really pick out at this stage which allowed McCarthy to make the challenge Of course his seasons gone by Glenn you'd like to see you centre-forward leaving a bit on the defenders and all that kind of thing but he's frowned upon these days Diego Costa in days gone by would have been a dream wouldn't he for the managers.;whisper-large;Ball out of play
612;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;298;330; But I think he does it too late as well. I mean whilst there's a challenge to be done Ok, you can understand that but I think he does it in between play he gets himself all ragged and he's got to keep a cool head He's got to be fat thinking about getting goals. Can't do it these days 10 corners for Chelsea This one delivered by Fabregas and delivered a long way away by Jackie Elkett.;whisper-large;Corner/Ball out of play
613;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;328;360; and it falls here for Zouma and the block made there by Jackie Elka and Zouma again seems to use his arm which the Everton supporters appealed for the officials didn't agree and it's a start for the second half of the season and the second half of the season and the second half of the season and the second half of the season and the second half of the season and the second half of the season and the second half of the season Zouma again seems to use his arm which the Everton supporters appealed for, the officials didn't agree. And it's a straight down here Zouma as well and Hazard will come in.;whisper-large;Throw-in/Shots on target/Ball out of play
614;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;358;390; Zouma as well and Hazard will kick it out of play so his team-mate can get some attention. Looks like the right knee, Michael, doesn't it? Yeah, not good, does it? Someone goes down holding the knee. Let's just hope it was a bang and not a twist because... One of the dangerous ones. Looks as if it was a clash of knees or... of the dangerous ones, looks as if it was a clash of knees or... It's Barry again though, Gareth Barry again putting in challenges all day long for his team and that's the job he's got to do today. I think he's just a;whisper-large;Ball out of play
615;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;418;450; He's played him in midfield at times in different positions, but I think he sees him as a centre-half long-term. He's become a dad this week, which is why he wasn't part of the French squad for the international break, so it's been a happy week off the pitch for the young French international. And he's back on the field here at Goodison Park as well. For Chelsea.;whisper-large;Throw-in
616;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;448;480; There's Pedro. Just a spin away here from Seamus Coleman, he's got that low centre of gravity and fantastic balance, Pedro. Couldn't quite link up this time though with Fabregas and Coleman can bring it away for Everton. Naismith towards Romelu Lukaku, it was a good idea from Nate Smith. Always got that option, having you to put the ball in behind the Chelsea defence and allow Lukaku to run onto it. Yeah, he works the channels quite well.;whisper-large;Ball out of play
617;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;478;510; Yeah, he works the channels quite well, does Lukaku. Obviously he's a big man, you need him in and around the box, Lincoln play, but he can make a good run into a channel. Here's Lukaku again. Gets just slightly quicker than McCarthy to it. Chelsea have only lost successive Premier League games once under Jose Mourinho, it came way back in May 2006.;whisper-large;Throw-in
618;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;538;570; Loves to burst forward down this right-hand side, John Terry across for Chelsea. His challenge leads to an Edmonton corner. Positive play from Coleman, getting at John Terry, he's thinking about taking it on the outside, but good defending. He's holding him off, stays on his feet until he needs to go on ground and make the tackle experience showing there. Barclays out here to take the corner this time for Everton. Sent Jackie Elker into the box for Stones as well, Stones is the target.;whisper-large;Ball out of play/Corner/Shots off target/Ball out of play
619;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;568;600; Well, Stones is the target. Stones has had it over the top of the bar. I know a lot was made about where John Stones might end up at the end of the January transfer window, but Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich, the two clubs who were linked with Seamus Coleman, and he's another player that Roberto Martinez is very happy to have here at Goodison Park. So here's the change, and it's an attacking change isn't it from Mourinho. John-Ovi Mikhailov and Kennedy on Glenn. Yeah, you felt always chasing the game as they are at the moment.;whisper-large;Substitution
620;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;598;630; chasing the game as they are at moment to one that there was going to be more of an offensive look to Chelsea at some stage in the second half and Favre Gas will slide in that deeper role and Kennedy's come out here on the left hand side so it's slightly personnel change I don't think the shape will change they'll have that rotation that they've been doing ever so well all afternoon it's just a matter of time can they just open Everton up and get that equaliser.;whisper-large;Clearance
621;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;688;720; who does do that job so well just outside his own penalty area able to use those long legs to win it back for Chelsea. He's raced with him with a challenge on Tetraudio and the result is a Chelsea throw. Good feet from Young-Barclay there, almost like a slalom wasn't it the way he's gone by Chelsea defenders there. Look, beautiful foot back, Matics doing what he's very good at, in and around that penalty area and then distributing it from there.;whisper-large;Foul/Indirect free-kick
622;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;748;780; It's been a good fixture as well, they've won five of the last six meetings between the sides of Chelsea. Lukaku looking to extend the lead here, and he's in here Lukaku! Straight to Begovic, and then a little bit of a mix-up between goalkeeper and centre-back, and the appeal from the back-pass too, and you can understand why the crowd and why the Edmonton players thought the free-kick should have gone there. Absolutely Darren, absolutely, that's got to be a back pass. John Terry just ran a get out the way for the goalkeeper and then just tapped it back to him as we see. He just touches it back to him and he picks it up.;whisper-large;Shots on target
623;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;838;870; Costner today. Here's Kennedy. Here's Kennedy.;whisper-large;Shots off target/Ball out of play
624;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;868;900; a relatively straightforward decision for Andre Marr in a back pass, wasn't it? I'd agree with you, Fletch, the only thing that Andre Mane has got to decide is a deliberate action. I've looked at it, he's got a clear view on it, unless he thinks he's just hit John Terry, but you can see there's a clear movement by John Terry's right toe towards the ball, which goes to Courtois, it's a back pass. Thanks, Howard. That clears that up. That won't please the Everton supporters, though, even though Howard's turned it up for us. They still lead 2-1, though, that will please them at this stage, and it's not the end.;whisper-large;Clearance/Ball out of play
625;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;898;930; Will please them at this stage and it's not been the Chelsea onslaught at the start of this second half, Michael, that it might have been, they finished the first half pretty strongly, but they've not been able to pick up where they left off so far. No, not yet, still a long way to go, half an hour and that man's still got a couple of substitutions up his sleeve, hasn't he, if he needs it, so... I'm sure he'll throw a little bit more caution to the wind as the game progresses. One of two new faces on the Everton bench, Aaron Lennon.;whisper-large;Clearance
626;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;928;960; the Everton bench, Aaron Lennon on there, and the Argentine, Romero, Fulis-Mori as well, and Gerard de la Fe, of course, who joined in the summer. A slightly deeper squad for Roberto Martinez to pick on following the closing of the transfer window. We'll be targeting the top six again this season as well, though he needs some significant improvement from his team to get it. 72 points in 2014, became 47 last season. Here's Lukaku. Terry over there and Lukaku.;whisper-large;Shots off target/Ball out of play
627;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;958;990; Terry over there and Okaki from an extremely tight angle chanced his arm Well I can't believe he was having a shot there, I think he just missed it across but as Bilicueta gets drawn out, leaves that channel which really exposes John Terry he doesn't want his full-backs to go too far forward means he has to make the run and follow centre-forward into the channel;whisper-large;Clearance
628;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1048;1080; Away by Fabregas, here's Barry, and Barkley, what can he do this time? Fabregas with him, Lukaku, now McCarthy, Steven Maysmith, now Kone gets on the ball, he's got a Vannevic over there with him, and he's going to try one himself. Straight from the big figure of Asmir Begovic in the Chelsea goal. He looks to set Hazard away quickly, although Jagielka across and then Barry Alonso.;whisper-large;Shots on target
629;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1108;1140; and in the end they get away with it there Chelsea, and now Petro can wriggle away. Hazard, Andre Marriner plays the advantage, Galloway it was who was late in the challenge. Here's Fabregas, now Costa. That's still Equator. And it goes towards Hazard, and Timell took matters into his own hands and that would be a Chelsea corner.;whisper-large;Ball out of play
630;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1138;1170; Yeah, expect the referee to bring play back a little bit here, maybe show the yellow card. Yeah, good refereeing from Andre Mane. Two-gallon range, fantastic, yeah. Good the way that play go on. It was a bad tackle on Padraigl, actually. Late and fully deserves a yellow card. Wonderful break from Chelsea though, great bit of football.;whisper-large;Yellow card
631;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1168;1200; great bit of football from one end to the other, four or five passes in there in behind and attacking Everton First yellow card in the game there shown by Andre Marriner for Brendan Galloway In goes the corner towards Tedrow No touch there from Mays Smith and the free kick to Everton I think even Treggsreau real realizes he wasn't going to get that one. Yeah, he went down.;whisper-large;Corner/Foul
632;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1198;1230; He went down quite easily didn't he? Here we see the yellow card on Pedro a minute ago, he just gets a toe in and it's never going to hurt Pedro like that but obviously he went to ground and you can't do that. Here's Barkley. Aaron Lennon preparing himself to come on for Everton. Lennon who was effective on loan from Spurs towards the end of last season, signed on a tournament.;whisper-large;Indirect free-kick
633;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1228;1260; end of last season signed on a terminate transfer on deadline day fabric ass up towards Kennedy the teenagers done well there for Chelsea now Costa if Manovich That one's out.;whisper-large;Ball out of play
634;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1258;1290; I think Mourinho looking there pensive would be a little bit disappointed that Chelsea haven't covered Everton's goal. You know coming in they finished the half really well, they played decent football in midfield but they haven't really created those chances that they look like they were going to do at the back end of the first half. There's Kono.;whisper-large;Throw-in
635;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1288;1320; There's Koenig, he's got a room to turn in the midfield, and now Nate Smith. And Valovic's committed himself, he got the ball, and then Koenig was helping out too, although that... Nate Smith was determined, and that determination's run inside the corner. Yeah, it's great, isn't it, a few tackles going in, the crowd are getting up for this, nice little knock-knock pass there from Koenig to Nate Smith, misses, almost a scissor action, wasn't the two foot scissor action the fans didn't quite like there but the benefit starting his 60th successful;whisper-large;Ball out of play
636;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1318;1350; It's starting his 60th successive Premier League match today right back for Chelsea. An interesting start to the season, hasn't even served. Here's the corner from Barkley away by Costa. Now Barry, Matics was behind him and Andre Marriner allows the game to carry on. Galloway for Everton, now Naismith, Lukaku, Askele Kekul, the defender, another good save from Begovic, and then Lukaku onto it again, and Askele Kekul...;whisper-large;Corner/Shots on target/Ball out of play
637;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1348;1380; and Askele Kroos in the right place to stab it behind his mate. Three important saves, Begumic. Yeah, terrific save, great first-time ball from Weismith. Has a go, cross to goalkeeper. But he makes sure it doesn't go from his body into the danger zone. Comes back out wide again, gives the defender a chance to defend it. Stones and Jackie Elker have gone forward, it's in towards Stones, away by Terry. McCarthy was looking to play it back out towards Barclay, and then left Kennedy's ball, lacking the necessary accuracy.;whisper-large;Corner/Ball out of play
638;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1378;1410; Lacking the necessary accuracy, and it should give both managers the opportunity to make changes if they want to do it now. There's Aaron Lennon and Radamel Falcao that will be sent on by Jose Mourinho. Falcao who is often running in terms of scoring goals, got the goal against Crystal Palace, albeit in a losing effort. There's some space for Kona who gives it Barkley.;whisper-large;Throw-in
639;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1408;1440; and Legsman, Galloway, touch came off the Chelsea man, Everton corner better spell for Everton now, with a little bit of ball in Chelsea's half they're obviously going to look to bring Lennon on and use his pace and his wit So there you get the Chelsea change;whisper-large;Ball out of play
640;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1438;1470; So the Chelsea changes, Petro replaced by Falcao. It's a real positive move by Mourinho, he doesn't normally look to play those two strikers together, but he needs the goal, doesn't he? So it's probably the right thing to do, but they've got to defend it well as a team also. Barty gets it back here from Baric. as a team also.;whisper-large;Substitution/Corner
641;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1468;1500; and Kennedy could play the ball away. Here's Hazard, leaps up to Falcao and then they're stringing forward here, Chelsea was an excellent ball from Falcao to Bramislav Ivanovic. Hazard wanted it, Costa gets it, here's Diego Costa, away from the challenge of McCarthy and then into Phil Jacquelka. And a really important challenge by Everton's captain, just a lick of time. Yeah, but from the Chelsea point of view, you're looking at it thinking, how have they got a shot away here? You think Ivanovic is going to shoot, and he decides not to.;whisper-large;Ball out of play
642;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1498;1530; and he decides not to, at the far end there's a ball in there, they decide not to play and then you see, Kostas onside, expecting him to get a shot off though. There's Fabregas, Fabregas towards the back post where there was nobody, it was too deep the cross, now Terry Hazard. Ivanovic's looking to roll away from Barkley and no free kick according to Andre Mourinho. Is that the kind of position last season? Glen Red Costa might want to take the first time when he was confident. He wouldn't have even had a second thought, would he? Inside the right foot, going...;whisper-large;Corner
643;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1528;1560; inside the right foot going across the goalkeeper. That's what I've been looking to have done. Here's Lukaku on the move, still Lukaku, he's got Kone up with him, but he couldn't quite pick him out with the cross. It's not the first time in the match is it where Lukaku's found himself in that kind of position for Everton today? No, and he does the hard work, obviously uses his strength, gets into a decent position, but this should be hard really you know it's a it's a poor ball, it's a miss it ball, you only have to either hit it, it's almost like a pass either hit it hard low across or ding it;whisper-large;Shots off target/Ball out of play
644;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1588;1620; under Roberto Martinez seems to have been around for so long he got into the first team at Leeds at 16, he's only 28 Aaron Lennon you think he's much older yes he's certainly got a lot of game time under his belt for an eight-year-old but got his pace now and I think the fact that Chelsea are gonna have to throw bodies forward playing with two strikers up there there's gonna be big open spaces for Lennon maybe to;whisper-large;Substitution/Clearance/Ball out of play
645;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1618;1650; It's interesting the fact that Mourinho's playing with the two strikers, Radamel Falcao and Diego Costa. They got 54 goals between them at Atletico Madrid in the 2012-2013 season. Falcao got 34 of those. They were very effective as a pair in Spain. Whether they'll be as effective these days post knee injury for Falcao in the Premier League then remains to be seen. I think that's the key, the knee injury. That was before the knee injury. They were so exciting during that season and Falcao was probably one of the best in the world, if not the best.;whisper-large;Throw-in/Ball out of play/Throw-in
646;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1648;1680; one of the best in the world if not the best striker at that time he hasn't quite got over that knee injury he's not as sharp but if you give him chances he'll put the ball back in the back of the net Willian looks as though he's going to be the next Chelsea change the final change for Chelsea Mourinho with 17 minutes to go. Tim Howard relatively untested in the second half. It's Falcao. Past Villaqueta.;whisper-large;Ball out of play/Throw-in
647;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1708;1740; Nicely here, and then Coleman's crossed up, what Lukaku was hoping for. And a throw in to Chelsea, so a massive week of European football coming up. All starts on Tuesday, Champions League tonight, Tuesday 6 o'clock, that's where the build-up starts. Gary Lineker, Rio Ferdinand and Steven Gerrard. Manchester City against Juventus, half past seven. That's available in Ultra HD, it's on BT Sport Europe.

Just fantastic to see a young English centre-back playing like that under pressure.

This is a real key moment for Everton in the game, what with 78 minutes they've made a few changes, why the new centre-half coming in, he's not going to be used to playing with Jagielka or anyone else and now John Stones is going to run it back. He substitutes on Lennon now from Set Blaze and I think this is a real key time for Everton to stick in there.

He's only really picked the ball out the back of the net once and that's about it. So Everton defend them really well despite the pressure. Julian's corner this time. It's gone out before it came back in again. So a wasted opportunity for Chelsea and a goal kick that will bring some respite for Everton. I think on the back of that as well, I think Lukaku has got to play a big part. When your team's defending like this, respite for Everton.;whisper-large;Corner/Ball out of play

Everton get the week off after this before they go to Swansea next weekend, but Mekabi Tel Aviv come to Stamford Bridge on Wednesday for Chelsea and then they've got the small matter of Arsenal Another game you'll see on BT Sport next Saturday and then the League Cup against Walsall It's a really important month ahead of us;whisper-large;Clearance/Foul

If you're going to come far out, you've got to get low, make sure someone's going to go over the top, but Naismith does all he can, hits it hard and low, and he's the hat-trick hero of the day. Well, if you would have said to Steven Naismith this morning, what do you want for your 29th birthday on Monday? You might want to set a hat-trick against Chelsea and that's what he's got.

Half a chance, though, wasn't it, for Valcao? More than half a chance, especially for him, who's so good in the hat. Just pulling back onto that back post, perfect little ball in from Hazard. I'm expecting him to do a lot better than that, but look at that way.

They all box office wherever they go and that's why Luke Shaw talks about the fact that he didn't quite realise how big United were until he signed for them and has been living the life day in day out. Gomez finding Taylor, Rallidge, time to spin, get the shot away! He was straight at the hair. It's another good chance. Ravage trying to spin, get the shot away. He was straight at the hair. It's another good chance. Oh, big, big goal at the KC. Yeah, not a great header from I think it's Steven Cole.;whisper-large;Ball out of play/Throw-in/Shots on target
1119;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;988;1020; Not a great header from I think it's Stephen Kolka but a really lovely volley from Nikic Jelovic, total control of the football, hauling the lead. You have to say, poor defending. Well he had so much time there at least to turn and get the shot away. Fellaini again, getting noticed by the referee for a poor challenge this time on Gomes Gomes just slightly overran it and it's the second low-confident;whisper-large;Foul
1120;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1048;1080; They move the ball around, they try not to lose possession. Gary Monk is doing his utmost to make sure Swansea don't just fade away. Because since they've arrived in the Premier League, they've tended to go into hibernation as spring has approached. Last season they won just four of their last 16. The season before was one in their last 10. And they've seen the tail in their debut Premier League campaign.;whisper-large;Ball out of play/Throw-in
1121;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1078;1110; I think in the first couple of seasons in the Premier League, the effort of getting to the safety points, if you like, is so great. Once you do hit it, it is inevitable to let yourself tail off. They had a cup final to contend with one year as well of course which saw another tailing off of;whisper-large;Ball out of play/Throw-in
1122;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1138;1170; the clearance. He's made a couple of errors in this game but overall he's been one of Manchester United's best signings this season, Marcus Rocco. There's Taylor. Now John Joe Shelby. Rocco's challenge on Gomez.;whisper-large;Ball out of play/Throw-in
1123;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1168;1200; on Gomez. Didn't have the pace on the ball for what Gomez was expecting there. He was trying to roll his man, let that ball run through, didn't have the pace on it. There's Wayne Rooney in the area he loves to be playing up front trying to cause defensive problems but Swansea City had the answer there. Di Maria, Rooney with a touch.;whisper-large;Shots on target
1124;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1198;1230; carrying the ball, a lot of the stuff he's done might go unnoticed but some of his one-touch stuff in and around the edge of the penalty has been good. Here it's another good run to take him across the front of his man. He just doesn't get the power on the strike. Well Tim Sherwood promised effort, energy and goals at Villa Park. He's repaying us as good as he's worried. Yeah, second phase from the corner, they don't deal with it. Fabian Delph delivers a wonderful cross.;whisper-large;Ball out of play

A kick so far, Mignot lost him in the previous corner after Key won the flick. Herrera's already got one off the line from a Gomez header. Variation this time, but it's finding as Shelby couldn't quite connect with it, says Williams.;whisper-large;Corner
1126;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1258;1290; with it says Williams now it's Rowledge nicely done by Jack Corke, Gomez with the shirt being held in the middle Fernandes was just behind it. And again, simple ball into the penalty area and I think that Federico Fernandes should have done better with this I think he's taken his eye off the ball as it came in, not quite sure the short corner routine worked out as planned but eventually the it came in. Not quite sure the short corner routine worked out as planned but eventually the ball came in. That's a reasonable opportunity on the far post again.;whisper-large;Ball out of play

Is that one of the things that can frustrate a fan, Barry, when you've sent two corners in and Gomez has twice worried Manchester United and then you try a short one? Well, it's nice to see that your team's been working on stuff and they've got alternatives, but you're right, if something's working and you're getting joy from it, keep doing it. And so often on short corners, that one there, it was a really poor lay-back to the taker and so often they don't...;whisper-large;Clearance
1128;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1348;1380; Changed the shape of the team. And you can see that sometimes. There's been a number of occasions already in this game where players clearly haven't misunderstood each other. We saw there between Herrera and Van Persie. They're still talking about it now. They lost possession because they weren't in the same wavelength. We spoke about Fellaini in the first minute giving away unnecessary cheap free kicks. From day one when he came over here to Everton he's done it, can't seem to get it out of him.;whisper-large;Foul
1129;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1558;1590; Wayne Rooney and Robin van Persie, it's produced six goals so far. The United strikers haven't been scoring really in 2015 so far, it's been in the fielders and the defenders doing the job. But here's Robin van Persie. Van Persie looking to tack a punch with his right foot, no direction. Sliced it, nice approach, lovely ball slid into him from Angel de Maria and he wanted it back. He'll just come into shot in a minute with his head held up with his right foot.;whisper-large;Shots off target
1130;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1588;1620; with his head held upwards. He thought that Robin van Persie should have played him back in there and that was the earlier decision where that was a tight one. Gomez wasn't a million miles away from getting in there. It's up to Bafet Gomez to lead the line now. There's a Wilf Bonny shaped hole in this Swansea City team And they have been struggling for goals since Bonny departed first of all for the African Cup of Nations and then for;whisper-large;Clearance
1131;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1618;1650; of all for the African Cup of Nations and then for Manchester City.

1132;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1648;1680; Look, Shaw's continued his run. Shaw, that's Wayne Rooney, Di Maria, and now it's Herrera! Pinpoint! He always comes up with something. He may not have convinced his manager, but the fans love him. And Manchester United hit the front in South Wales. What a fantastic goal. Amazing build-up. I think it was a little bit of luck with the finish, I think it was going wide until it took a slight deflection but the approach play.;whisper-large;Goal
1133;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1708;1740; Well he's launched that forwards, it may have, well it did take a flick of Ashley Williams on the way through, but he's found the back of the net, and if Herrera does get that it will be three goals in three starts for him, a player who is really finding his feet when chosen at Manchester United. You just sensed something was coming up didn't you, when Luke Shaw started Moulton down that left hand side, a little triangle exchange of pass on the halfway line, fling him back into his path and he was away and that's the type of run that prompted Manchester United to pay what they did for.;whisper-large;Kick-off
1134;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1738;1770; Manchester United to pay what they did for him. That's when he's at his best and really involved almost inevitably. The start to this game that he's made has been superb. Well Swansea City, I mentioned, have been struggling for goals, they need one now.;whisper-large;Ball out of play/Throw-in
1135;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1768;1800; That's Jonjo Shelby, swept in towards Key! They weren't behind for long! Swansea City react in the best possible way! Great run from Key. A good ball in, and a smart finish, I have to say. Swansea didn't have to do anything particularly outstanding to get that ball in and a smart finish, which we have to say, Swansie didn't have to do anything particularly outstanding to get that ball in there. The marking's poor. We've got bodies.;whisper-large;Goal
1136;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1798;1830; They've got bodies in there, Key's got across the front of his man, it's a ball into a great area, but Manchester United have got to defend better than that. Give Shelby credit, lovely ball in, great run from Key in a smart finish, but the defender played a part in that. Well his first ever Swansea City goal came against Manchester United, that was at Old Trafford on the opening day and they are in his line of fire again.;whisper-large;Kick-off
1137;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1828;1860; 1 minute 56 seconds between both goals, that's how long Manchester United had the lead for. Well Swansea rarely fail to score here at home, and they've responded brilliantly. I was just about to say as Shelvey was drawing his foot back to throw that ball in there, you know how expensive were those two misses that can go miss early on deep but the backs who were;whisper-large;Offside
1138;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1858;1890; on B but they're back to level pegging. Well you know Gary Munk had to do plenty of convincing to keep Key at Swansea City in the summer. He had a loan spell at Sunderland last season, a really successful time as well and Gus Pleyett wanted to take him permanently But he feels that this is his home and Gary Munk after lengthy discussions Persuaded him to stay here;whisper-large;Ball out of play
1139;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1888;1920; to stay here and he's been one of Swansea City's best performers this season. Yeah, it's amazing isn't it how you get players and managers and coaches that there's just something doesn't work between them and the same player comes back and is a success. I mean he's always been a good player, he was a record-signer I think for a brief period of 5.5 million so there's no doubt in his pedigree but just couldn't get in the team under the previous regime.;whisper-large;Ball out of play/Throw-in/Foul
1140;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1948;1980; He's got three to pick out to his right. He's tried to find Paddy McNair who can't finish with his right foot. But he wasn't given a moment's tease by Rallage. There's McNair again. Well, another sweeping move again from Manchester United. Again, it's down the left. Terrific footwork on the halfway line from Van Persie to release Angel Di Maria. Well, another sweeping move again from Manchester United. Again, it's down the left.

Nicely done by Herrera for Laney. Robin van Persie trying to bend that into the back of Fabianski's net. You can see exactly what he was trying to do. The lay-off was just a little bit too far away from him to enable him to wrap his left foot around it sufficiently to bring it inside the far post. He'll just want his equaliser again. Too easy for me.;whisper-large;Throw-in/Shots off target

Yeah, a bit of history between those two as well, isn't it? Julian Williams and Robin van Persie after a spot of bother here a couple of years ago. Good work again from Rooney. It was a difficult bounce in Bale, he had to gather it. Good first touch and then a nice simple layoff to keep possession for his team. He's had a terrific half, the captain.;whisper-large;Clearance

Fellaini again has brought himself to the attention of the referee who now brings up the yellow card and says that is the fourth time. Well the referee didn't think he was going to book him actually but in the end he got the yellow card.;whisper-large;Foul/Yellow card

Being back in the Champions League is a must. Van Gaal has to deliver a top four place this season. They're on course, they can't afford to slip because they'll see Southampton, Arsenal, Spurs and Liverpool all coming over the hill. 1-1 here at the break and Manchester United have brought on Antonio Valencia to replace Paddy McNair at half-time.;whisper-large;Kick-off/Substitution
1155;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;28;60; time a straight swap right back that's Di Maria, Luke Shaw still ahead of Rooney now it's key there's Gomez putting himself around again round again. Good play by Blaine.;whisper-large;Substitution
1156;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;58;90; Good play by Blind with Valencia pushed on there, there's a big hole to the right hand side of United's defence and that's what Daley Blind does of course, fills those holes and protects his back foot. A flag muffle straight, Baffet-Gomes again here. And I think Paddington there can consider himself a little unfortunate there because in that last move there we saw United, Luke Shaw has always got plenty of support and help available to him Paddington there was pretty much to his own devices down that right;whisper-large;Offside

Again, almost the exact spot on the other side of the pitch where Shelby threw the ball in for Key to equalise. And Key again has got himself free. Les and Luke Shaw who really should be picking him up. David Blins will absolutely furious with his defenders.

Angel Di Maria with this corner kick, the change straight into the gloves of Fabianski. Everybody went near. And Angel Di Maria over hit the cross.;whisper-large;Corner
1162;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;358;390; Probably for the first time in this game, as Patz didn't come off. It was about to start, the first time was at 1-2. One touch pass is that he's produced so many in the first half, didn't find its target. And Chesnow to have won just three times away from home in the Barclays Premier League this season.

And then with the Maria hit it low. And on that occasion we had bodies at the back of the penalty area. And he's hit it low to the near post. Well on Fellaini, he has jumped to the edge of the box. Ashley Williams is keeping a keen eye on them, there's a five-yard gap between them. Fellaini will have the run on Williams here. Rooney with the corner, much more uncomfortable for Fabianski that time.;whisper-large;Corner
1168;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;628;660; so far, it was a big goal here against Arsenal. I know but still not a fantastic goal scoring record he's got here at Swansea is it?

You can't say that Louis van Gaal isn't going for it. He's got two wingers as his two full backs, three attacking midfielders, one holding and two out and out strikers on the pitch at the moment.

The world the other way around because the weakest team in the air game during this current season the Premier, the team that has scored 16 goals in the first leg, but that couldn't defend that header from the left back Benmi. Mourinho, there we see Ivanovic;whisper-large;Ball out of play/Throw-in
1454;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley;2218;2250; There we see Ivanovich who can't go out against Vans, Mourinho who quickly changes the profile of his Re-change in the field and Keihil will enter, let's see what a Vaux's action Vaux who receives the blow from Zouma, Inx was looking for the launch against Terry And now Gaby logically changes, Drogba will enter and Keihil Gaby, logically, will enter Drogba and Cahill again stays on the bench. I think Mourinho saw more clearly the possibility of keeping the goal to zero than to make the second.;whisper-large;Ball out of play
1455;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley;2248;2280; He's got to do the second. I'll tell you something, Mourinho is regretting not having made the change to Cahill before. Because if there's a central, in addition to John Terry, who manages and who controls in the air football, it's Cahill. Let's see that ball from Arfield looking for Ings who ended up on the ground. The ball is brave and that must be praised to the team of Shin Ditch, which is not conformed with the tie to one in a stadium where only the city has been able to tie and that must be praised;whisper-large;Throw-in
1456;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley;2338;2370; The Chelsea are desperate right now, they are completely out of it. First, he was hit by the goal from Barnley, and then he has one player less.;whisper-large;Ball out of play
1457;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley;2368;2400; center and there is Zouma who anticipates with two men behind him waiting for the service from the right so Keihil will come in, well not Drogba, sorry Drogba, for Felipe, we were talking about Drogba, sacrificed Felipe Luis and Drogba who will help the team to attack, let's say, to use less seconds to reach the finishing area with direct play.;whisper-large;Substitution
1458;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley;2398;2430; direct. Keihil is the one that came to my head because I was thinking that Mourinho has surely regretted having put Keihil in before. Because he has scored a header goal, a goal that can be very valuable. Many things have happened in this game. Let's see the service there, which was going towards the first post after the shot by jones from the mirror dropa we will have to listen to maurinho after a game with that hand;whisper-large;Corner/Ball out of play
1459;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley;2428;2460; of a game with that hand of Kiteley. The penalty to Diego Costa above all. But Kiteley's hand is also very clear. The action in which Neymar Jamatic is expelled can also be felt Yes. It is also harmful to Chelsea. They have clearly harmed Chelsea because Vans had to be expelled. Obviously, today Chelsea have reasons to complain and when they have them, many times Mourinho complains without having them.;whisper-large;Throw-in

Sez, from the ground, manages to direct the ball towards Hazard, the center of the Belgian, it is taken out by King, William touches, opportunity there for Sez, he goes up, he was throwing that ball and in the end he ends up finishing off Zez Fàbregas.;whisper-large;Ball out of play/Throw-in/Shots off target
1463;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley;2608;2640; He's not attacking that ball well because obviously the ball will bounce and if it bounces you have to throw yourself much more over the ball so that the clouds don't go away. His body goes a little backwards and the ball in an almost inevitable consequence goes up.

1464;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley;2638;2670; all the intensity that you have to put in until the rival has just ascended of less quality than the premium It complicates a game beyond arbitrary errors, of course, for me they have clearly harmed Chelsea Totally agree and it will bring a tail but many stages of the Chelsea game have played at a very low intensity level and At this level that type types of games are always complicated.;whisper-large;Clearance
1465;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley;2668;2700; He may have felt mistreated from an arbitral point of view, Chelsea for specific actions which have clearly been damaged, but Chelsea should have reached that moment of Matic's expulsion with a wider result, with a result that would have allowed him to have the game in the back of his mind. It wasn't like that and that opened up the possibilities of the barley, which has had its merit to sustain itself. And of course we have to thank the team of the Barley.;whisper-large;Ball out of play
