Blue shirt, white pants, his starting uniform in front as well. With a blue shirt and pants. Crystal Palace, the surprising second of this Premier League. 2015-2016. As always, the best football in the world here at Movistar Plus, because we are the home of football. The ball is already for Jouhard. Now we talk about that last victory of City before;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
2;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;28;60; for the Euro 2016 qualifiers and we saw it here in Movistar Plus. 2-0, a well played and well won game for the Pellegrini with goals from Raheem Sterling and Fernandinho against Wadford from Kike Sanchez Flores and against a Palace that gave a punch on the table at Stamford Bridge with goals from Sacco and Ward against Chelsea. Yes, of course, it was one of the big surprises of the last match, that victory of a good Crystal Palace, a Crystal Palace with all the virtues that we have mentioned before, with that energy, that intensity that the team has.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
3;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;58;90; energy and intensity that the team has, but also with moments dominating and dominating Chelsea well, so we saw a great version in all the senses of the Palace, which is up there for a moment for its own merits, and Alampardio in the final stretch of last season showed us very good things with this team, he already did it to perform at a very good level. And that Newcastle had become almost the number one public enemy of the McPeace fans, be Careful that he hits the area, Volasi, the shot high. Now the forward of Crystal Palace, first chance of the frame of Johart. A little selfish, he asks for forgiveness there.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
4;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;88;120; A bit selfish, he apologizes there. He's a very difficult player to stop in these transitions. We see how Kolarov has lost his position, he wins in the back to the Serbian side, who arrives late. And there he finds Volasi square meters to make his own. This is a player who, like Manchester City, does not watch closely. In this type of speed, it is very difficult to stop. A very explosive player, the forward with goalkeeper, where the ball is there, the guard metal.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
5;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;118;150; When the ball is in his court, Alex McCarthy kicks it long, looking for the position of Yannick Bolasi. The ball goes perfectly in front of Zagat, he gives him back the care that the Idesens' saga can break. The center is sent by corner, Vincent Kompany, who asks for an application because the Palace is coming very easy. Yes, we already see that there is direct football, that little is thought of the Palace. He takes advantage of all the spaces that Manchester City are leaving in between the lines at the start of the game. With the team quite wasted and not very well placed.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
6;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;148;180; and not very well placed and then the that that so direct style is not that verticality of the local team we are going to see the first corner of the game he throws it there in that send back and he took out the shot that the whole armada of the crystal palas was looking for that arrived there to the shot in the corner kick there There's no time to lose. The corner kick for Martin Kelly. It's overpowered. Perfect. It's in the area.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
7;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;178;210; He passes the ball, he hit it well, he quickly leaves it, Volasi asks for it again, Volasi in the shot, total siege of the post, the shot that ends in the hands of Jouhardt, who sends to the corner. Yes, and he does well because it was a ball that was poisoned and if he tried to block it, it could probably generate a problem, that ball also came with a lot of effect. I think Jouhardt is conservative but he does the right thing because of the effect of the ball. The team's goal from Adam Patiuk. And also when this team plays with this one from Tomas,;whisper-large;Highlight
8;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;208;240; The team plays with this determination, it is very difficult to stop because physically it is a very powerful team. Now the corner for the Palace, the fan is delighted, ball to the second post, there was a shot option but impossible. For Papé Suagé, another authentic express train, no? That has already become fashionable, a real high-speed train. The Senegalese side. speed, the Senegalese side. He tries to play there, but the ball does not last very long for the Pellegrini. Back to the walks, he has to go out with Pani and impose his quality there.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
9;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;238;270; He puts his quality there. Very good, man. And above all, cold blood to cut in that position. But look at the ball, the team overexcited, recovering the ball and going at full speed, generating very serious problems for City. Now he tries, the leader of this Premier League 2015-2016, the ball for Sergio Cunahuero. Calm down, gentlemen. It seems to say there Argentine. The ball is now for Nasri. He's going to try to make it circulate. In short, for Kolarov. Servio with Fernandinho. In between the lines, there's the goal.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
10;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;268;300; between lines there is the cuna güero connects with wiffre boni holds there the marfileno opening good that band for jesus navas the center of spain boni turned the neck at full speed and with power but did not surprise macarthe well we have not commented eduardo but in the end there is joan cabas in the first 11 he has been talking all week since the international commitments ended in which by the way, Cabage couldn't finish the game against Portugal, he had to be replaced, and it was said that Cabage was injured, and in the end Cabage is in the final.;whisper-large;Highlight
11;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;298;330; Cavas was injured and in the end he's in the 11th. I guess he's a bit off because it's hard to go from being low to being high in the morning. I think he's not 100% fit but it's the right eye of his coach. He already had it in Newcastle and it's in Crystal Palace. A record for a transfer in the history of the club. He's a great player and today he's in the starting 11th. He's a great player and today he's in the starting eleven.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
12;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;328;360; Manchester City, the ball for Wim Fred Boni, who starts, it was a 2 against 3 and there is a defensive balance of the Eagles and there is a lack on the ex of Vitesse and Suonce, among others. Yes, Manchester City also knows how to be vertical, not only on the pitch of the Palace and when the Palace loses the ball, watch out. We are live, about to score. Aysamir Nasri was avoided by the goalkeeper Alex McCarthy. The English director was surprised when he was going to recover from Manchester City.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
13;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;358;390; match this series. If we lose a second, we lose something important. I'm sure the English director has already taken note. Yes, it doesn't happen to him again. It is a very high-speed game at the moment in which the ball does not stop coming from one area to another and where, without glamorous occasions, but situations of goal with frequency.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
14;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;388;420; but the City that grows for that is the leader of the Premier League. What a mistake there in that loss of the sleeve, Volasi can take advantage of it, Volasi in the shot, Joe Hara stopped. What a stop, eh? Below blocking another ball loss, this very serious one in Manchester City, at the exit of the team and how few doubts the Crystal Palace has. As soon as he recovers, it is pure verticality, it is pure vertigo, the team with Volasi, which is a real nightmare. There, we haven't gotten to see if they had any other better option this year.;whisper-large;Highlight
15;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;418;450; Is there any other better option? This is, by the way, repeated, the action that the director took. A good shot with a lot of intention from Yaya Toure. He is trying. The match between Cesiri and Nash, Ripana Colaro, offering the area, he ends up getting it out. As he could, Scott Dunne, ball in the outfield. A game played by Tuatu, from power to power. And from area to area. The game is not centered on the pitch. It's a real vertigo by both teams.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
16;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;448;480; There is that ball from Nasri. He's going to play it there with Fernandinho, Yaya Toure. Ball opened by Bakari Sanyah. He's going to try it there from the band, Nasri. It was Jesús Navas, and he takes it out of the band for the match of the series. In the end, it's Zaha who is on the left. the;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
17;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;478;510; Volasi will play in the front, but he can play as a second forward or in either of the two sides. He is a player who has speed and any of those positions is good for his type of play. The game has started with all the machines in this Seahorse Park. In a Grey's Palace Who wants to show why he is the second in the table and that he can tutor today to the best team of the Premier League;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
18;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;508;540; of the Premier League. Short ball there for Martin Kelly to try. In anticipation of Kolarov, Kelly plays back again. The ball is from Scott Dunn, connecting with the Norwegian veteran, Brede Haangeland. A life insurance for Alan Pardew, a very expert player for a Crystal Palace that, for good insurance, did not expect the season the season like this, but he is marveling at his best start since the 2006-2007 season, when he also won the World Cup.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
19;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;538;570; when they also scored 9 points in the first 4 games. They also scored 5 wins in the last games of the league, and that makes Palace start to respect them a lot. Of course, and I say that all the virtues that he is showing are not a result of chance. All the good things that this team does, how aggressive it is and how fast it plays every time it steals the ball, the;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
20;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;568;600; to defend against such powerful players. We're not just talking about fast players like Navas or players with special technical quality like Agüero. We're talking about players with a brutal physical level. That's why every time the team shows so aggressive in the pressure and so vertical in the exit, it's hard to stop. Then what already costs him a little more is to attack in positional, but that's why Johan Cavas is there, to get the ball out played like now.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
21;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;598;630; There are problems for Bakari, Sanya and a foul in that action at the speed of Wilfried Saha. Yes, we already said that he is on the left wing and he is asking for them all too. There in the face and Sanya has no choice but to make a foul. Ten minutes of game in this stadium of Selja's Park with Crystal Palace trying from one to one to be the leader of the Premier League Arriving with opportunities, especially those two that have already had Yannick Bolasi, the Congolese player;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
22;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;628;660; Yannick Bolasi, the Congolese player, who is currently the best striker in the team that directs Alain Partiu. There he is, five men from the Eagles in the area, he tried to score but it was complicated there. Bakari takes out, ball is released for Swagghe, the left-back shot of the Palace is deflected. How is Partiu's team coming along and how is the Premier League leader suffering? the;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
23;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;658;690; The ball hit was too flat, there were no options for the refs but in the rejection the ball fell to Suarez and he didn't think twice. What a great start to the game of the Palace. Three chances for the Eagles for only one of the citizens. How is the Celeste team suffering in this clash of the fifth day of the Premier League. We were talking about how they haven't scored goals yet, but they are seeing how the Palace comes again and again in this match.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
24;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;688;720; He's got the ball in this game and Hart is suffering in a clear way in this starting line-up. There's Volasi, as we said, playing more inside. He's not new at all but sometimes he plays on the left, instead of Zaha, who we're seeing today. Even on the right, where today we are seeing Asako. Those four footballers are very interchangeable, Zaha, Punshon.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
25;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;718;750; Zaha, Puncho, Sacco and Volasi are very similar, very fast, very physical. With a lot of mobility to the ball, bounced at the end, Wifre, Zaha, mobility, speed, power, they appear everywhere on the pitch and they get you. It's almost a 4-2-4 what they play because they have the line of four in front, Kavach who does a more constructive job, with MacArthur who is more destructive and then these four that we are saying that I already say that they have a very similar pattern and that all four of them are very similar.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
26;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;748;780; very similar and that everyone plays at high speed. Well, the cut there from Greg Hangeland, who comes to Crystal Palace, seems the leader and on the other hand it seems the modest team, although second in the table, the match Chasiri who is capping the season as he can, there is a lack, says Mike Jones, against the aggressiveness, the speed and all the intensity that the Adam Part the team is putting on Adam Partio.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
27;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;778;810; The current Premier League champion is doing the same with Manchester City. A brave way of playing football. That usual Alan Pardew gesture that seems to be very angry in the team. Sometimes I guess it will be. It will be true. But he keeps transmitting intensity to his players. City has to try to take the game to their own ground, try to make quality prevail, even though today obviously they are the ones who are going to win.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
28;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;808;840; quality, although today obviously without Silva, it costs him much more because Silva is the galvanizer of this team. Jaja Toure in short with Kolarov, the cut of the Serbian. Returning that ball, Jaja Toure with problems Fernandinho manages to unload for Sergio Agüero. The ball has it there in the front, Wifre Boni opens for Navas, the Spanish is going to face in short for Agüero. The ball is in the front of Wiffrey Boni. He opens for Navas, he's going to face Espanyol. Agüero in short, he's stuck in the city. The Kun loses it.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
29;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;838;870; Yes, the Kun takes advantage of the fact that today they play with two points and that Boni is the center forward to come a lot to receive between lines. Navas is going to look for the center there. The ball is from Yaya Toure. Bakari Sanjar sends it to the area. Hangela cuts it in the first post. The ball directly to the side.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
30;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;868;900; A beautiful match that the second and leader of this Premier League are offering us. Crystal Palace, who started the season winning at home to Norwich by 1-3. Then lost here at Seahouse Park by 1-2 against Arsenal and later two consecutive victories.

32;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;928;960; Tore, in short, Balanavas puts it there, Andaluz, and he takes it out of the band. I think this is what is most convenient for Manchester City. Of course, it is at risk, having so many people in front of the ball, that when a loss occurs, they can take it against them. But that the team has the ball and tries to move it from one side to the other, that forces the ball to go to the ball lane, seems to me the best recipe, taking into account their technical superiority over the other team.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
33;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;958;990; considering his technical superiority over the rival. Nasri, in short, there for Agüero. The kum tries there, but very well covered in that action by James MacArthur, the Scottish. Juan Corto Agüero for Nasri. The ball is from Mangala. Again, Nasri.

34;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;988;1020; He still has enough gunpowder in the field and in the bench for today's game. Yes, and he also has De Bruyne in the bench. We are all saying that what a depth of the locker room Manchester City has. Today is one of those days when you can see the depth of the locker room. What happens is that I think that in such a complicated game, in such a narrow field, with such an aggressive and physical rival, I think that Manuel Pellegrini has not wanted to make De Bruyne debut. He will probably make his debut in the second half, we'll see if there is a need or not.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
35;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;1018;1050; We'll see if there's a need for it or not. But probably for a match like this, he preferred Nasri's experience in the first 11. Careful with the ball, so that he can try it. With a lot of problems, Volasie, the send with that free kick, inside the area, so that Johan Cavas has tried it, he lost it to the international, the city wanted to go out there, the foul is very hard on Agüero.

36;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;1048;1080; We could not see the foul. It did not look good, the way the cuneagüero hurts. What a power of Volasi again. Volasi, who in addition to speed, is that he gets into the body, well, what a kick. What a kick, tremendous, yellow, just for Dan, for a cuneagüero who was going. And here we have the previous action action we have not seen the origin which is another action by Volasi having won the back of the defense and also once;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
37;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;1078;1110; And once he does it, it's almost impossible to take the ball away from him because he puts his body in and it's so physically powerful that it's really complicated. I hope it's nothing. That way of hurting yourself doesn't look good at all, but I hope Agüero's injury stays in shock. The international foul with Albiceleste, a serious gesture of concern in Manuel Pellegrini, Agüero's.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

Manchester's team, and what a foul, very hard from Dan, with that kick on Kun Agüero, he wanted to stop him, no matter what. The central of the Palace, 28 years old, first yellow card today. The central;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
39;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;1138;1170; because few could expect this performance from a team that is always in the middle of the table, or even more down than half the table. Yes, but we already commented that last season when we arrived at the Ampardio, the team had a very evident reaction, very clear, a very clear improvement. And this is simply continuity, because there maybe there is a penalty for Fernandinho maybe there is a penalty for Fernandinho;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

Agüero can't continue, what a pity. What a pity and what a hard post for Manchester City, we remember it, if someone has arrived late to the broadcast.

That job that he often touches when the team plays 4-2-3-1 and he is the most advanced man. Today Boni was 9th and he could come to receive more.

Suagué is back, Yaya Toure starts with power, connects with Boni, now very late. There comes the play to defuse it, giving oxygen to Kevin De Bruyne on the left, although there was already a 2 against 2, De Bruyne's center is very closed, giving oxygen to Kevin De Bruyne on the left, even though there was already a 2 on 2. De Bruyne's center is very closed, on Macarthur's goal. A bit rushed there, the Belgian.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
155;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;1888;1920; The Belgian is very excited. Leaving lights and shadows in his debut, some brilliant actions, others not so much. It is also logical. It is not easy to enter without a warning and in a game as difficult as this one. It is a game that can be decided in a small detail because it is very very closed in the first part in the first 20 minutes it was defended with much order in the match in syria although at the moment it was almost seen to crime and already the first half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of the second half of;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

Once again, City up. Now Jesus Navas, Abilita Abakari Sanja. A short for Nasri. He's going to try to break through the axis. Follow Nasri. In short for Boni. He keeps it there, leaves it for Kevin De Bruyne. De Bruyne wanted the pass for Navas. Ball loose, Peliga wins again.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
157;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;1948;1980; The ball is in the net. Walde starts for Jokard. City have a great ambition. With a lot of people in front of the ball, taking risks and winning the game without any doubt. There goes Samir Nasri, about to lose. He helps him to win the ball. Nasri is about to lose, but he helps him to win the ball. Nasri in the short for Kevin De Bruyne. This is again the French player.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
158;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;1978;2010; The Frenchman is back on the field. Crystal Palace is behind the ball. De Bruy is not losing the patience of City. Nasri can lose it. Nobody warned him that he was coming from behind. Janik Bolasie, Gale, protects. He stays with the spherical, looks for the ball up. Perfectly placed. Ilieke Mangala. City is coming to get the ball back. Navas with the Bacariz-Añar team.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
159;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2008;2040; with the company of Bakari Sanja, follows Jesus Navas, the ball has been at the foot of the Spaniard, Navas now very locked up, it is a 2 against 3, Sanja back to start, the Pelegrini team does not lose faith playing and playing to find the gap in the Zaga de los Eagles, De Bruin, association with Alexander Kolarov, the Serbian already has it, there goes Kolarov, there could been a push. Let's see what Mike Jones has said, because it is not so flat and we have not seen it. What he had pointed out.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
160;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2038;2070; what he had pointed out. There comes Kolarov very well. City plays very well again. De Bruyne puts a very good ball into space. Kolarov, who wins the action to Zaha, who is working a lot, the truth, but who misses. He's going to fly away, if he hasn't had in the second half not a single chance to show his speed and hurt Manchester City. City, I insist, dominating the game with the ball and suffering very little.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
161;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2068;2100; and suffering very little and Jedinak enters. There is Mike Jedinak who has been doubtful during the week.

Suage puts the center with the left foot, Wilfred Boni blocked the Chilean. De Bruyne, face to face with Nasri, ends up taking the ball from Jedinak, from that guisa. But he hits the post, what a kick from Eliaki Mangala. He will open the yellow card, very clear for the Frenchman. and;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

He went in from behind, without a ball option. With a lot of violence. The impact is very violent. And... And well... The game that has had several very strong episodes. Very hard. As expected, on the other hand. With the Crystal Palace. The game has had some very tough episodes, as expected. With Crystal Palace, if you want to win here, it's like going into a house.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
164;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2158;2190; You have to face the owners to get out with the three points. It's very complicated. Alampardiu is getting stronger with Crystal Palace after having a bad time with Newcastle in the last seasons. In San James Park, when he prepares a new change, the third in his team, Palas.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
165;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2188;2220; There has been a clear defensive change, which has been the last one with the entry of Jedinak in the field. Now we are going to see who leaves, but obviously Alan Pardew does not want to lose the game. He signs the tie without any doubt, he is letting him see with his changes. He's letting Ver with his changes. And he has a lot of merit if he gets it. To draw against Manchester City. First game in which City would not score a goal.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
166;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2218;2250; and the team would not score a goal in the season. Jason Pancho leaves, another damaged player in this battle, Sergio Agüero, now that he can't continue and is's going to the back of the net. This is Pancho.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
167;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2248;2280; Lee, there are many Lee's in Korea, even many Chun-Jong. This is the one who was in the Bolton for those who follow the English league the most. He was already there last season, although he played very little in the Palace and this year he has also started as a substitute. Gabi has already taken Lampardiu out of the field, to his three points, we points we would say bolasi sack and punchy I have Zaha and now Lee and now he has a center field;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
168;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2278;2310; And now he has one more midfielder with the presence of Jedinak to give him more redness if he fits in the center of the field. That indicates a priori, we will see what happens later, but it indicates in the first instance that the Palace could give a point for good. But not always attacking with many forwards implies that you are going to win the game, nor putting Amas in the center of the field. He wants to stay behind. Wifrey Saha tries it now. Martin Kelly in the center. Ball hanging to the penalty spot.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

170;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2338;2370; The way Suarez plays the ball from the left wing is spectacular. The lateral centers that Suarez takes out with that left leg. Tense, powerful and with options for the finish. Platonic, right? They are authentic bananas. For the forwards there is nothing better than the typical tense ball and also with that arch to be able to finish it off. and also with that bow to be able to finish it off.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
171;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2368;2400; The game is almost over, 5 minutes left, but Mike Jones is still missing. He's missing the marfil. He hasn't been shining today. It's hard to start, we've seen Fernandinho better. He's played well in defence and attack, but Yaya Toure has a lot of experience. He knows how to manage the tempo of a game. You always have to wait for the best of him. In the start, in the middle, or in the epilogue, in the outcome of each clash. Now the Palace should better entangle the City game with the presence of Yedin Akai. Instead, maybe, maybe...;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
172;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2398;2430; I think he could have come sooner and maybe prevented City from dominating with so much clarity. But in the last minutes with Jedinak there, he has a big action radius and is a very aggressive player too. The goal from Bakari Sanja, anticipation about Wifre Boni from Mike Jedinak. What a goal from Vincent K Pani, Mike Jones, Pani, who is not yet in the game, but Eliakin Mangala.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
173;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2428;2460; Kim Mangala. Vincent Kompany, the captain of the citizens. This is... The city has to be well focused here so that the game doesn not escape them with a ball stopped action in which the palace is fearsome.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
174;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2458;2490; There's the foul, Ballon at the half moon, he got to extend Jedinak, Sanja's clear, he chases it and now it's in Jesus Navas, without concessions Johan Cavas, Navas today very active, very fast, a shame that he failed that clear opportunity in the 54th minute of the game. If I remember correctly. I think it was a little before. In the 50th. In the 50's. Just starting the second half, that magnificent counter from Manchester City. One of those that shouldn't fail.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
175;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2488;2520; Those that shouldn't fail, obviously. But at the time of the finish, Navas unbalances a little. The ball is lifted slightly and it's hard for him to place his body to hit with the left. Ball for Jesús Navas. The Spanish keeps it there. He leaves it short for Bakari Sanya, the 32-year-old French side veteran who made the trip from London to Manchester, leaving Arsenal to join Manchester City.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
176;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2518;2550; Fernandinho and Kolarov, Kevin De Bruyne, now it's not clear, the Serbian and the Belgian, the Belgian and the Serbian. Three minutes to go to the 90. The next match, Crystal Palace will travel to White Hart Lane, will not move from London to measure Tottenham Hotspur, while Manchester City will receive at their stadium in West Ham United. And they will do it with the World Cup of Rugby already started. West Ham United.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

I know Edu that he is very much a rugby fan and I love this sport but I don't like to play in football fields. Ferguson neither. I don't find it strange. And the explanation obviously seems obvious but the most curious of all is that he, who is still a very important man in the Manchester United scene, does authorize that they play Rugby at 13, which is another Rugby modality, which he doesn't seem to care about. There was the shot!;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
178;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2578;2610; It seems he doesn't care. There was the shot, in goal. Gale takes it out, far from the frame of Jouhard. 7 meters, 32 centimeters to place it. And a shot out to Gale. One of the few times that this City reminds us of last season. A team that breaks in half when it comes down. The City was doing a great second half. But look at what occasion the the Palace had in this final section with City, I insist, in one of the few times that we have been able to see this this season.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
179;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2608;2640; He didn't get to see this this season. City lost in the middle of the previous years. Crystal Palace are about to win the match in a couple of games. Jedinak came in, incredibly. City's dominance faded completely. And by the way, a future phenomenon has just entered, if he wants to. And he's a focused guy who demands Nacho. Watch out!;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
180;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2638;2670; Now the City with Kolarov, Hija and Nacho won't get there. The ball for Kevin De Bruyne, the cut is dry, it's De Bruyne's. Yaya Toure is asking for it, he's desperate. Kolarov returns it, it won't be given to Yaya Toure. Kolarov, center of the area, the ball cleared by Scott Danner. Now he's getting the ball out for the City. Exciting final straight. Final stretch, exciting. City try again, with Baccaris to Fernandinho, good help from Gale, but Nasa...;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
181;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2668;2700; Fernandinho, good help from Gale, but Nasri reacts, Nasri shoots, ball loose, goal! Manchester City goal! The mistake of the goalkeeper Macarthur and it was to enter and kiss the saint, it marks and says to Nacho the goal in the minute almost 90 of the game. Well, impressive, we just talked about him. I didn't have time to finish explaining how good he is, although here, obviously, what he has had is opportunism more than any other virtue.;whisper-large;Highlight
182;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2698;2730; He's a real opportunist, more than any other virtue. The 18 year old kid, Ijeanacho, who we saw in the U20 World Cup, a real phenomenon in power, a player with an incredible talent, but here the one who shows an incredible talent is Nasri, who for me is the player of the match. Nasri is, in the absence of Silva, the player who has turned the team around today. In the absence of Silva, the player who today has turned the team around, has helped him in the second half, Manuel Pellegrini, has sent him to play inside, to step on the ball a lot.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
183;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2728;2760; He was inside, stepping on the area a lot, not playing in a row, but playing with more freedom inside. He appreciated the detail, being the best and playing the game, which is this one. How he receives the front, how he breaks, attracts, of course, as always, three or four rivals. But instead of looking for the free-kick, what he does is shoot, a great shot, there is a rejection kick, but he shoots. A great shot, but he's rejected. And there's the kid. First goal of his life for the Manchester City shirt for Higia Nacho.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
184;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2758;2790; for Higia Nacho. He's only been on the pitch for three minutes. Kelechi, Higia Nacho, the Nigerian player who has scored the goal that could be the victory for the the Eidisens, although there are still four minutes left. Five minutes are being added to Mike Jones. Joe Hart comes out and catches it safely. What a game ending. So as not to lose anything because the Manchester City match has front of us with that goal from the Nigerian youngster. It seemed that the match was set for a draw.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
185;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2788;2820; He's tied at 0-0. I saw him in a U17 and he left me speechless. He's a great player, a natural talent, an immense one. He was in the last U20 World Cup, which was played in June, and he didn't shine that much there. But I've seen him in several games as a child, which is what he is practically still. And today can be a day remembered, because today is his birthday.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
186;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2818;2850; It can be a day remembered because today is his first goal with the Manchester City shirt, which belongs to him for many years. Those luxuries that rich teams allow themselves to make preventive signings, signing guys who stand out in the whole world and having them there or in their academies and when they are old enough, they are given out there. I think that Gia Nacho is one of those who will arrive. Of course, he has plenty of talent.;whisper-large;Highlight
187;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2848;2880; hungry. Crystal Palace to stay with a point against Manchester City. There were the flowers with the ball in his power of Jokhardt to win a few seconds. 93 minutes of the game, only two left in front according to what Mike Jones, the coach of the clash, is adding. This fifth day of the Premier League the next, the sixth, Tottenham Hotspur, Christian Palace, in White Hart Lane, and the stadium, Manchester City, West Ham United.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

189;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2908;2940; Absolutely perfect. It would be a 5 out of 5. 5 out of 5 and not a single goal received. Only goals in favour, no goals against and for me it's not just that, it's sensations. I've already said it in other games that I've played. Sensations of a mature team, much more supportive with respect to... Madurado, mucho más solidario con respecto.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
190;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2938;2970; Was there anything out of play? Well, that he had to save because he had gotten into trouble. Or lack of Hangeland. There is lack of Hangeland, you understand, that he hit him a little with his arm. Yes, yes. Well, what I was saying, a Manchester City of unbeatable sensations, in the sense of control of the games, to defend much better than last year and previous years. I like this city more than the one I won last year. And I mean the one I won with Pellegrini.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
191;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 17-00 Crystal Palace 0 - 1 Manchester City;2968;3000; Pellegrini I mean. And nothing, start of season impressive, already has put 11 points to Chelsea;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
192;england_epl;2015-08-08 - 19-30 Chelsea 2 - 2 Swansea;-2;30; Well, everybody starts with nothing. Chelsea's eight-point lead is gone. 11 weeks ago, they finished 31 points ahead of Swansea. But here they are, side by side on the start line. They are equals. The champions of 2015 begin their defence with the ball at the feet of their number one star, Aiden Azahar.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
193;england_epl;2015-08-08 - 19-30 Chelsea 2 - 2 Swansea;28;60; threatening to penetrate very early and Jefferson Montero did well to make up the ground. Fabulous start from Chelsea as Montero originally breaking down the left-hand side but Chelsea proving they're quick to counter-attack. Looking to get Costa in the game as soon as possible and I think this will be interesting for Chelsea. Do they start like last season and blow teams away or are they pragmatic like the second half of the season? Do they start like last season and blow teams away, or are they pragmatic like the second half of the season? Hoska's corner with Whip, up into the air by Gomes, in again by Cahill.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
194;england_epl;2015-08-08 - 19-30 Chelsea 2 - 2 Swansea;58;90; Gommies, in again by Cahill, partially cleared by Kyle Norton, it's awkward for Taylor, Ivanovic recycles, Oscar heaves it in, Costa is round the back, and ripples the side netting. Difficult chance for Diego Costa at the far post, as it comes back across, you see Swansea have got to do better. Gary Cahill wins that header, Ivanovic plays it out wide. Driven to the far post, I think really cost us... Got to get his foot round that.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
195;england_epl;2015-08-08 - 19-30 Chelsea 2 - 2 Swansea;88;120; and Costa's got to get his foot round that and just sort of loop it back towards the far post. But that man is the difference. So Alex Ferguson, in his time, used to drive his team on to win trophy after trophy, and I think that's why the Chelsea are the favourites this season, because of Jose Mourinho. Last year, as you rightly say, Chelsea just flew out of the blocks, it's a habit they have, they haven't lost a Premier League game in August since 2006. 27 August games unbeaten. They left the rest behind right from the start a year ago.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
196;england_epl;2015-08-08 - 19-30 Chelsea 2 - 2 Swansea;118;150; right from the start a year ago. Started that season on Monday night at Burnley and won, they were unbeaten in their first 14 games. Norton for touch. That's Pellequeta with the throw. Left full-back, the only position where Chelsea don't appear to have two obvious alternatives now that Philippe Luiz is gone, it's an area they may strengthen. There's talk of Danny Rose from Spurs, we'll see.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
197;england_epl;2015-08-08 - 19-30 Chelsea 2 - 2 Swansea;148;180; of Danny Rose from Spurs, we'll see. There's Cahill. Ivanovic. Snatched upon by Taylor. Who is certainly first pick left full-back for Swansea this year, because Chas Richards has disappeared to Fulham in the Championship, not so very far away from here. Fernandes. Fernandes. Chelsea's pressing already, it's really obvious to see. The moment that Swansea get on the ball...;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
198;england_epl;2015-08-08 - 19-30 Chelsea 2 - 2 Swansea;178;210; and the moment Swansea get on the ball in the defensive half, Costa pushes forward, Hazard pushes forward, William all trying to put those Swansea players under pressure. We know how good Swansea are at playing out for the back, and Chelsea trying to stop it at source. Shalvey, key. Last year, you may recall, scored on the opening day at Old Trafford, where Swansea won. Lifted forward for Costa, Fabianski came to very good effect, who last year you may recall scored on the opening day at Old Shafford where Swansea won. Lifted forward for Costa, Fabianski came to very good effect, it's a splendid and important piece of judgement from the Pol.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
199;england_epl;2015-08-08 - 19-30 Chelsea 2 - 2 Swansea;208;240; He's landed an important piece of judgement from the pole. Hazard, away from Ayub. Northam got a piece of it and Williams found Khabiansky. That's a concerning sight for Chelsea folk. Is that Oscar down? I think it is. Yeah, just having a little look round. Looks like he's maybe just caught a bang in the face. Courtois obviously went down in the water.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
200;england_epl;2015-08-08 - 19-30 Chelsea 2 - 2 Swansea;238;270; and Portois obviously went down in the warm-up. Unfortunately for Swansea, he's fit, but of course they have a fantastic replacement, Inazmiro Begovic now as the second-choice goalkeeper. Not quite seen it, but I think Oscar might have just taken a little bang as he made that challenge with Key. Having a look there, can't see anything too much. Slow-motion replays don't really give us an awful lot. Has he gone down after that challenge?;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
201;england_epl;2015-08-08 - 19-30 Chelsea 2 - 2 Swansea;268;300; And after that challenge, doesn't appear to, he might have caught a finger in the eye there. Maybe that's what it is, you know, when you see him holding his eye there, perhaps it was a fingernail, nothing more. Taking a scratch in the eye, Oscar, who got a couple of goals at Swansea in January, in fact he hasn't scored in the Premier League since then. In fact, he hasn't scored in the Premier League since then. Couldn't start the Community Shield. Home on for Ramirez to the left.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
202;england_epl;2015-08-08 - 19-30 Chelsea 2 - 2 Swansea;298;330; came on for Ramirez for the latter part of that game. And since last weekend's fairly tepid Wembley showpiece, Chelsea actually have played one more friendly game against Fiorentina here on Wednesday, they lost that 1-0.

Just said moments before, whip that across the goal, if nobody touches it in off the far post, he's missed the far post by about a foot. But that's exactly the problem the goalkeeper has. Look at the angle there. The goalkeeper's expecting Gary Cahill to get a touch. If not, Ivalovic gets a touch. The goalkeeper's got no chance to react to that.

Powerful, full of bulk and will. Willian stayed with him. Always so difficult as a defender when players are prepared to get the ball and run at you.

That's almost twice he's been caught out now. With Gomez just peeling off and then running that diagonal in behind him. But I think this is going to be a little bit of a worry.

They played some really cohesive football at times in the first half and whilst they had that momentary wobble, they've broadly speaking been in charge.

Ayew's been bright and lively, obviously it's got his goal, so they do have an attacking threat, but I think if they're going to have any success, get Montero high up the pitch, get him the ball and let him run at Ivanovic. Of course, Lusikovic is capable from this range, John Joe Shelby likewise.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

Ivanovic did all he could to keep his hands out the way at some personal expense, I think. Diego Costa misses that first opportunity, and Gomez, he just hesitates, doesn't quite make his mind up early enough, and that gives the Chelsea defenders just that fraction of a second to make a block. Good start to the second half from Swansea, Shelby's corner.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

Headed over by Fernandes, who is still to score his first goal for the Swans, having in the first half notched one inadvertently against them. Well, that's a couple of chances from set-pieces that Swansea have had. They had one in the first half, Ivanovic got left wanting it, Gomes got across them at the near post. And like Chelsea so far, defensively, they've given away probably four or five half chances.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
293;england_epl;2015-08-08 - 19-30 Chelsea 2 - 2 Swansea;178;210; probably four or five half chances, which is very unlikely.

I'd like to see that again before establishing whether Courtois actually had it covered, but it was certainly a heart-in-mouth moment for the Chelsea keeper.

Let's hope this is really a case in point and continues for the rest of the season. Shelby. Too much loft for Cobbis. Wasted this time from Shelby.

Do you think that was deliberate? No I don't, the way that the ball came in it looked like a little bit of a miss hit, didn't look like he hit it particularly cleanly. Costa. Willian. Costa. William.

He does have the goal that's broken his duck for the year now from the spot. But again, look, he's just running off the back. This is the goal, or the opportunity that leads to the penalty. He just runs off the back of Blaise, that's the third time he's done that. It's very, very difficult to tell whether that's inside or that's outside. Look at the referee's position. The referee's got no chance of spotting that. And I think, look, the ball is going away from goal.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

But the big debate is going to be whether it was inside or whether it was outside. By the time we get technology and slow motions and virtual reality lines, we might have a clear view. But if the referee and linesmen aren't 100% sure, they can't give that but all fair play to Gomez did his job put the ball away Montero, Gomez, Shelby;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

And habitually it's the sort of game that Mourinho has gone to as it were settling to the point he starts with and anything else is a bonus. Those big away games against United and City and Arsenal.

I don't think it will change Mourinho's mindset at all. You know, two points down for two games, yes, he'll be disappointed, but you can probably only lose four, maybe five games if you're going to win the Premier League title.

I'm sure that's the question the fans of both teams will be asking as the second half gets underway. It should be an intriguing 45 minutes this day. It certainly should.

De Bruyne tries a very ambitious effort, but the whistle had already gone for a West Ham free kick.

Good shot for a penalty from the fans I have to say, Aguero's appeal was rather more half-hearted. I think it's Winston-Reed who's on Aguero at the front post.

Just couldn't shift his feet quickly enough, Kevin De Bruyne. Possession at this stage is absolutely vital for West Ham. James Collins hounding that back line up the pitch.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
752;england_epl;2015-09-19 - 19-30 Manchester City 1 - 2 West Ham;2518;2550; The pattern of this second half was set very early on and has hardly changed. Jelovic. Nandinho there to win it back. He says leave it to me. Otamendi.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
753;england_epl;2015-09-19 - 19-30 Manchester City 1 - 2 West Ham;2548;2580; Here's De Bruyne. Iannaccio making an angle for him, and it goes back to Fernandinho. Toure. Sadia. Now that's picks out De Bruyne. That was a push I think. Yeah, through kit to West Ham. Yeah, yeah, Toure just trying to get in behind there as he's done so often in the second half.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
754;england_epl;2015-09-19 - 19-30 Manchester City 1 - 2 West Ham;2578;2610; so often in the second half. De Bruyne and Ndiaye Aturi looking the best bet for City in the second period. Is it going to be enough? Well the resolve that Bilic's team have shown in the second half has been quite magnificent. Absolutely. There's been non-stop depression, it's not been periodic, it's been incessant.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
755;england_epl;2015-09-19 - 19-30 Manchester City 1 - 2 West Ham;2608;2640; and they've done that, whoa! Hart suddenly had to react there. Disappointed he never took it in there, Joe Hart. Because he knows West Ham will try and run the clock down in the corner here. It's an awkward one for him. Kicks up just in front of him. Just about pi at the end of the second half. And he's got the ball. He's got the ball, he's got the ball, he's got the ball, he's got the ball, he's got the ball run the clock down in the corner here. It's an awkward one for him. Kicks up just in front of him. Just about Piotr's first sighted goal that away.;whisper-large;Highlight
756;england_epl;2015-09-19 - 19-30 Manchester City 1 - 2 West Ham;2638;2670; That's the first sight of goal that the West Ham fans packed behind that goal. Surprised they're not taking the shot, surprised they put the centre-backs up. That one pulled it back to Creswell, who's gone himself into a good position here and then committed the foul. Worst of a corner, wasn't it? It was. Maybe there's going to be quite a bit of stoppage time, but now you have to name your man of the match. I think you could take your pick in that West Ham backline, but for me Winston Reith has been absolutely outstanding.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
757;england_epl;2015-09-19 - 19-30 Manchester City 1 - 2 West Ham;2668;2700; and Reit has been absolutely outstanding today. Up against one of the best in the business, Sergio Agüero. His defending has been heroic. Completely agree with you there. Will he finish on the winning side though? In a moment we'll find out how much referee Madly is going to add. Otamendi, de Bruyne. Otamendi, Dubruyne, Navas, Hesania;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
758;england_epl;2015-09-19 - 19-30 Manchester City 1 - 2 West Ham;2698;2730; Thank you.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
759;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;-2;30; So what's next for Chelsea? And can Everton get their first home win at the Premier League season? And even though it's only the fifth league game they've played, the champions can't afford to fall any further behind Manchester City. There is the potential this weekend they could finish 11 points behind in the race for the title. This is a huge game for both of these teams today. Yeah, it is. A nice little early sharpener, a wake-up call, you'd say, for Brandon Galloway there.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
760;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;28;60; there, Padre on him like a flash. Closing him down quick, he's gonna, well it's a big game for him today with Padre, the experience of Padre running at him. I know Galloway hasn't trained much this week so Martinez might be a little bit worried about that. And the ripple of applause around Goodison Park for the first touch for John Stones which won't surprise anybody. Here's Matic for Chelsea and it's going to be interesting Glen isn't it early on in this match just to see how the the balance in the Chelsea side looks today bearing in mind John-Ovi McHale comes in to start for the;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
761;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;58;90; in mind, John-Ovi Mikel comes in to start for the first time this season. Yeah, as we can see that he's gone square of Matic, they're playing deep in front of the two centre halves and Fabregas is playing in the pocket, just in behind Costa. The key is Mikel will give you the defensive responsibilities, for me he's got to look forward more and if Fabregas is clear, if he's in space, he doesn't get the ball in there quick enough. So, Eden Hazard, who was doesn't get the ball in there quick enough.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
762;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;88;120; Ivanovic with the first chance to get forward and the first touch for the Edmonton goalkeeper Tim Howard as well. Barkley sends it forward towards Lukaku, that's going to be an interesting battle today isn't it? Both of them strong and both of them quick. Kurt Zouma up against Romelu Lukaku. Here's Mikel, Pedro, Fabregas. Pedro who's got some license to roam in this Chelsea 3.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
763;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;118;150; Chelsea three. Now Costa, who looks to get the nutmeg from John Stones with the Gladys Street end already singing their new favourite song, but he can't buy you Stones. Well he will be delighted with that first contribution to the game, a little nutmeg from Costa, but strength, anticipation, clears the danger and gets a good ripple of applause again from the Gladys Street end. It's often suggested isn't it that this is where the Premier League season really starts the first game after the international break and the closer;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
764;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;148;180; after the international break and the closing of the transfer window. All of the managers now know they've got the full compliment until January at least. There's Kone, just looking to slip it through there towards Lukaku. Hazard towards Diego Costa, who at this stage of last season...;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
765;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;178;210; who at this stage of last season already scored seven goals for Chelsea, including a hat-trick against Swansea. Just the one so far, and you wonder whether this is the day when things can really explode for the Spanish international. In the meantime, here's Besic for Everton, but a bit of hesitation from Zouma, who was unable to make the challenge on the Everton midfielder at the ex-council of corner. I think you're right there, Darren in hesitation, all right, Zermak will come in, quite clearly, clearly his line's there, but he just moved back and that message's run at him. Nice little break from Ayrton.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
766;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;208;240; Nice little break from Averton but as you see here, I thought Zouma can come across and he just holds his line and holds his place. I think there's an ankle injury maybe here for Vesic. Yeah, it's good defending from Zouma. We thought as Michael said he might have come out and cut it out but I think Vesic has gone down and he might have pulled a hamstring or something. He doesn't look happy there the boy. Well this is the concern for Roberto Martinez. Tom Cleverly's already in a place that could be...;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
767;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;238;270; Tom Cleverly's already in the place a couple of months out with the injury. Of course Aaron Lennon was drafted in during the course of the transfer window and Kevin Miralles is among the Everton subs as well today. He was also the the victim of one of the most bizarre dismissals I think I've seen. He was sent off for throwing chewing gum at one of the Andorra players and he's off the field for now for Everton, it's at Barkley;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
768;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;268;300; He's able to get the cross in via the deflection, and the first calling card left on Asmir Degovic by Romelu Lukaku. Yeah, it's an early ball in Barkley, he really should have dealt better with it, but yeah, Lukaku's just put his elbow into him a little bit, letting him know that he's around and he's going to be physical today. I think that's sometimes a good tactic as well from the centre forward. Goalkeeper caught it quite cleanly and it certainly was a foul but Lukaku just to give him a little nudge, a little bang, next time he comes for a;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
769;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;298;330; Next time he comes for a catch, he'll be thinking to himself, I hope he's not round me. Everton with the ten players at the moment, with Besic still receiving a little bit of treatment off the pitch. In the meantime, here's Tetra. And Mikel Fabregas. Space out wide here for Ivanovic, which was closed down quickly by Brendan Galloway. Petro was on the move in the penalty area and then Galloway;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
770;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;328;360; in the penalty area and then Gareth Barry back there shielding the Everton defence, a job that he's done so well down the years for a variety of clubs. Here's Tedrow for Chelsea, now Fabregas quickly to Hazard and then Mikel, now Ivanovic who have got plenty of white waiting for the cross. And Brendan Galloway gets back into his defensive position to make an important challenge on Branislav Ivanovic. Yeah, we see Basic just coming on now and he is. Glenn was right, he's holding his hamstring so it's definitely a win for him.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
771;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;358;390; He's holding his hamstring, so it's definitely a hamstring injury, and I'm astonished to see him on the pitch still. Here's Hazard wiggling away, we hear that Steven Naismith is preparing himself on the far side. Away by Jackie Elka, not very far, now Kono, they're a little bit boxed in here, Everton. And in the end, that's Pillequeta, runs out of room, and Everton get the goal kick, but it was a decent pressure there from Chelsea. Yeah you saw different phases there of Chelsea they looked as if they're at it with the ball and brisk their movements excellent Hazard's coming off these;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
772;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;388;420; Excellent, Hazard's coming off these perch, coming in there causing problems, Pedro will do the same. Nevertum have really got to be concentrated defensively. There's Seamus Coleman. So without his usual partner in crime in the other full-back position for the moment, Leighton Baines. Pedro wins it back for Chelsea and then was looking to set Hazard away. Lovely little knock-knock again wasn't it from Padreau there.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
773;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;418;450; Little knock-knock again wasn't it from Pedro there, classy. Just saw someone running right out and he slips it through the legs. It's interesting though, you put a shape up at the beginning of the game of Chelsea and when they're in possession that shape just goes out the window. They've got so much good movement with Pedro Hazard making movement. They're really doing to change well at the moment. Thank you.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
774;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;448;480; He's beaten Tidy from Everton to get it forward towards Lukaku and then Besic was on his way. Now Barkley, and a wrap-fist through the penalty area without a touch off Ivanovic, and it's the Chelsea goal kick. Well Besic seemed there, Michael, to give one last effort to try and make an impact on that Everton attack. Yeah, and that's why I say I was astonished he's tried to continue the first time, he actually bursts into life again, it goes, and that's a hamstring injury for you this is his initial injury you see there his left leg just almost well it goes out;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
775;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;478;510; Well, it goes there, I know exactly that feeling, I'm just so surprised that he came back onto the bench, because once you do that and you see his reaction, he knew he'd done something bad. And we'll be replaced by number 14, Stephen Naismith. So, Besic's opportunity in the absence of Tom Cleverly lasts less than nine minutes and Steven Naismith who got the winning goal here the last time Everton beat Chelsea in the Premier League at Goodwood.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
776;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;508;540; and beat Chelsea in the Premier League at Goodison Park is the man that's going to be sent on by Roberto Martinez. Slightly different type of player isn't he, Nate Smith-Glenn? Yes, certainly is. He's just going to fill the same role though. He's come out here on the left-hand side. He'll work up and down and Ivanovic is pushing himself way way forward so I think he's gonna have to tighten up and get across and help help the pullback out;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
777;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;538;570; the full-back out. As Mikel providing a bit of muscle in central midfield which is what he's been brought in to do today by Jose Mourinho. Chelsea's worst start to a season for 20 years, three defeats already. They only lost four matches in all competitions over the whole of last season, 50 plus games, which illustrates just how out of character this start has been for the defending Barclays Premier League champions. But they started well here and Tedro in particular getting on the ball early. Now Ivanovic and Galloway, not for the first time.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
778;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;568;600; and Galloway not for the first time across quickly to be in the right place to block the Ivanovich cross he did particularly well there, he just held up play a little bit, Naismith got caught and you see him there he got caught on the other side of the pitch and all of a sudden it was 2 v 1 he just held his ground, held his ground, bought a bit of time, went with the run up, could defend him from the youngster he was the under-21s player of the year last season Brendan Galloway, still only 19, started the first three Premier League matches of the season And they're back in today with Leighton Baines still out. Here's the corner from Pelley;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
779;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;598;630; Still out, here's the corner from Tedrow and the defending done this time by McCarthy Back in by Fabregas towards Zouma He was just able to get half a yard in front of Gareth Barry, but couldn't find the right finish As the corner comes in there just one interesting thing at Naismith's Marking Ivanovic, that to me looks like a better one this one I think if Chelsea see that from the bench, Ivanovic gets a signal. They've got to play to him. Great space and let him be 1 v 1 with him because he'll outmatch him.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
780;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;628;660; space and let him be one be one with him because he'll outmust him. the;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
781;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;658;690; With a real press from Chelsea, hasn't there, early on? Trying to prevent Emerson from playing out from the back, which is what they like to do. Here's Kone. Seamus Coleman's made a really good run forward from right back, but Kone couldn't quite get it out to him, although he will now. Here is Coleman. And there's a morbid for Everton here from McCarthy. And in he goes towards Naysmith, who just tried to ghost out.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
782;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;688;720; Naysmith who just tried to ghost in towards the far post to get in behind Ivanovic. Yeah, it's a good, decent ball in, isn't it? Ivanovic has closed himself off, really. Not really aware of Naysmith, it's inches from him getting in on the back post. But that attack comes from John Stones, not panicking in front of his own penalty area, under pressure from Costa. Football in centre-half, goes inside him and sets up an attack. It was a real goals feast last season when the sides met. 6-3, 2-2.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
783;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;718;750; 6-3 to Chelsea, six of the nine goals were scored in the second half. It was a day as well where Everton had 61% of the possession or thereabouts, and still conceded six goals at home. Both of these sides at this stage of the season without a home win so far, Chelsea and Everton. He's Azpilicueta, of course Babarachman was one of the players brought in by Chelsea during the win.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
784;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;748;780; brought in by Chelsea during the window. He's not even on the bench today, the young Carnaian International. Here's Petro. Naismith going quickly for Everton. Now Barrett. Lukaku. Didn't fall for Naismith but it will work its way through here to Ross Barkley.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
785;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;778;810; Galovic, good football this from Everton, if Anovic though manages to nick it back for the champions and now Matic can bring Chelsea the other way. Here's Hazard, Tedrán, but Galloway again working back well defensively and getting the ball back for his team. Had a really good start hasn't it, left back the oaks to Galloway. Yeah, it's a big test for him, we mentioned at the start of the game, against a spare inter-pad go with Vannevic, just kind of support him as well.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
786;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;808;840; and support him as well, so a lot of the time he's had two men but done well so far. Of course, Howard Webb with us again here at St. Goodison Park today in the truck, any contentious decisions that we need Howard's assistance with, and he will provide it during the course of the game here on BT Sport. Service! Service!;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
787;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;838;870; It's nearly done by Barry. Here's Lukaku. McCarthy looking to get it forward slightly quicker this time. Aruna Kone. Ivanovic was always going to be favourite for that one. Lovely quick ball from McCarthy and that's what Everton have got to do. When they can play forward, can they play it forward quickly? Here you see Ivanovic here, already done his defensive duties much better.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
788;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;868;900; defensive duties much better. That's been a question mark about him this season and he looks like he's got a real defensive head on him. That little kick out there wasn't from Neysmith but he did kick the ball first and then just had a little bit of a follow through of Van Vich and I know exactly where he's coming from. Oat's first straight end in the world as one of the defenders, but shielding it out, you can't get past them to get to the ball. Jackie Altrera away.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
789;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;898;930; How did Chelsea look in midfield for you, Glen? We talked about the balance this morning, we talked about the fact that John-Ovi Mikail's coming alongside Matic, are they slightly more solid in there? Much more solid, Flitsch, much more. Here's Diego Costa, Hazard sends him away, still Diego Costa really good defended by Kozak Jadielka. The kind of chance last season, Michael, that Costa would have gobbled up. Well, I think he was just waiting for the penalty there, I think he was thinking Jagielka was going to make a little contact and then he would go down because it was certainly an area where you think it's going to be a penalty.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
790;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;928;960; because it was certainly an airy way you think it's going to be virtually impossible to shoot he had the need to cut back inside or win a penalty just a little bit of a bit far out with a bad angle to let one go Just getting back to that Chelsea point in midfield there Fletch definitely Matic and Mikel not getting in front of the ball staying behind the ball even when Chelsea are in possession and seeing pressing all the time doing his, but they're protecting the two centre-halves and allowing the four up front to really go and play.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
791;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;958;990; And we also saw the benefit there, Gleder McGolki with a decent first touch, that was fizz-backing, wasn't it, to Tim Howard. Here's Galloway. And Naysmith. Good skill to get away from Matic, and then Galloway and Everton are looking on the door here, and Naysmith has come off the fence to score the opening goal against Chelsea, just to add to Jose Mourinho's early season troubles;whisper-large;Highlight
792;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;988;1020; Well for a lad of his size, he doesn't half-win some headers. There's another one to go on his tally, fantastic play down the left-hand side again. You mentioned him earlier, Brendan Galloway, he's given Chelsea something to think about now. He's started with Naismith and finished with Naismith, good turn. And that's a fantastic ball in that corridor that we always talk about between the defence and the goalkeeper and he keeps it down, does Naismith, lovely header;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
793;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1018;1050; Smith, lovely header. That's a great run into the box from Ney Smith, he's played it and he's gone again, but for me, Zouma's sleeping, Zouma's got to get across, he's got to be on the goal side of Ney Smith and he clears that, he's sleeping. Well, it's an early birthday present for Steven Ney Smith, who's 29 on Monday, scored the winner the last time Everton beat Chelsea, and he's got the Merseysiders ahead inside 18 minutes here at Goodison Park and it's another problem to add to the growing list for Jose Mourinho and Chelsea.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
794;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1048;1080; Mourinho in Chelsea. There's Miquel. And As-Pilicueta, the noise has just been ratcheted up an extra notch since the Everton goal. As-Pilicuia, the Chelsea challenge there by Seamus Coleman. And then Aruna Kone via John Stones able to get it away. They certainly don't lack for confidence, do they, Everton?;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
795;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1078;1110; lack for confidence do they have a team with the players out from the back? yeah and it stands on the back now, stands from John Stones that calming influence that's what you call an impact off the bench Glenn isn't it? well it is and sometimes you know I don't think Martin Les would have been ever thinking of making that substitution but by injury Rezic has to go off and Neusen has come on and made the difference and he looks dangerous. What I liked about his goal is he played, he didn't stand and watch his good pass, he put himself in the box.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
796;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1108;1140; and watch his good pass, he put himself in the box. Terence Amarini have made the decision before the game to bring back John Terry and pair him with Kurt Zuma today, Gary Cahill is amongst the Chelsea subs today having played for England during the international break. Neither centre-back can do anything about the Steven Ney-Smith header. Here come Everton again with Seamus Coleman, and they've got plenty of blue to pick out as well, in it goes towards Kone! And Ovejkovic's got a fingertip to that, fantastic save!;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
797;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1138;1170; Everton so close to a second goal they look so threatening when they come forward. Yeah great save from Begovic but again I thought Coleman was going to swing it in straight away because Everton had the numbers, look at that, three men in the box, not a bad header from Cooney just didn't quite have the power on the cross to get the necessary power. And Barkley somehow gets the short corner back again. Now McCarthy, Everton play with so much confidence and they test short corner back again. McAfee, Everton play with so much confidence and they test Begovic again, who for the second time in quicksand.;whisper-large;Highlight
798;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1168;1200; and for the second time in quick succession, equal to it. Yeah, great spell of football from Everton now, really getting confidence from the goal they've got. Good strike, good save again, Begovic right on good form. Everton can keep the pressure on with the corner, which is delivered in by Barkley this time. Cleared as far as Naismith. Now Barkley. That's Pellecretta and Diego Costa combining to win it back and then Galloway quickly on Pedro. This is looking good.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
799;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1198;1230; on Pedro but this is looking like a big five minutes or so for Chelsea isn't it Glenn, Everton really have their tails up now. Yeah they've got to show a lot of character it's not just about silky football this is the ball in from Kone, it's a decent header and what a great save, fingertip save, he's half anticipated it but lovely ball from Kongman and that's a decent header, he's hit the target wonderful save but no sir it's a testing time for Chelsea now. This final minute they've got weather, the storm, compose themselves and people even getting into the top four players. Those players up front, there's something going to happen.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
800;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1228;1260; those players up front, there's something going to happen if they keep believing in themselves. Andre Marriner who's the referee today sent off Mitrovic the last time we saw him on VT Sport. There you go, Costa just leaving that little bit on Brendan Galloway. Yeah, and a little bit of an air-bashing as well from the assistant linesman which... from that distance...;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
801;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1258;1290; From that distance was probably quite frightening for him, but he's got that end, hasn't he? He's got that nasty streak in him, Costa, that's what makes him tick. Maybe looking for something to get him going again as well, he's only got the one goal this season, in fact he's only scored four times in his last 17 Chelsea appearances back towards the end of January, he was so lethal in the early weeks of last season, Costa. Here's Naismith with another one! And that's a double to lead! And what an introduction, Steven Naismith!;whisper-large;Highlight
802;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1288;1320; Well, Chelsea have given Everton all kinds of space and they're running rampant in these last few minutes. Ivanovic, he's backing off, that's his man. They're taken off and away from Neysmith. He gets the ball in a bit of space, opens himself up and thumps it with his left foot. You see Everton breaking and it's just too easy, they're getting onto the back forward, Chelsea. Ivanovic, he does nothing, he stands there, you know, the force and what not.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
803;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1318;1350; He stands there, you either force him wide or you close him down and he just stands and stands and invites the shot, well, you're gonna do that pick that out the back of the net. Chelsea were so solid as they virtually cruised to the championship last season, Glenn, but they are being ripped apart here by Everton. Well, they are and Mourinho's got a massive problem. He's put Mikel in there and told Macic and Mikel to stay in there and make it nice and tight and they're 2-0 down With 22 minutes gone, so he's got to he's got to do something from the bench here. He's got a look for attacking He's gonna have to change his;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
804;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1348;1380; look for attacking, he's gonna have to change his midfield shape and go for it a little bit more. Big big problems for Chelsea and that man Jose Mourinho, two little downs for Ermitit. And just listen to the atmosphere inside Gunnarsson Park now. I want my Mbappe of it just made a couple of fantastic saves already obviously there's been;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
805;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1378;1410; Obviously there's been two goals, but it could have been four for Everton already. Chelsea really haven't threatened Everton's back four at all yet. 2-0 scoreline is fully justified. Here's Costa, now Matic. Costa has just left one of the Everton players on the ground. The attack continues with Pedro, he's just popped up on the left-hand side this time, but there's not much on the ground and the attack continues with Pedro, he's just popped up on the left hand side this time but there's not much on the shot and Tim Howen had it covered and Seamus Coleman back on his feet after that collision with Diego;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
806;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1408;1440; after that collision with Diego Costa. Well these two have had a little bit of previous haven't they? You just see the flailing arm there of Costa, Flicks Coleman in the face. It's lucky that the referee didn't see that. We talked about the problems, Glenn, that Jose Mourinho's got. What do you do? Put yourself in his position. 24 minutes gone and 2-0 down. What's the next step?;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
807;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1438;1470; and it's gone a 2-0 down, what's the next step? He's got to change the shape in that midfield and go a bit more offensive, you know, it's no good, it's not good hanging on to this result, he's got to get a goal and then build from there, but, you know, they've got the players to do that, but at the moment, they're all over the place. Tex Robe, looking to try playing through towards Fabregas who've made a run from midfield, now Matic. Chelsea have now conceded 11 goals in what is their fifth Premier League match of the season.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
808;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1468;1500; They've conceded more goals than any other side, Sunderland and Manier are two-nil with 10. Of course, Chelsea have played 24.5 minutes more than them so far, but just not something you associate with the Mourinho side, easy to score on, and that's been the problem in the early weeks of the season for them, and it's very much in evidence here today, Barclay caught there. Goal!;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
809;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1498;1530; That's for Laqueta in quickly on Kone. Here's Ivanovic, you might just be thinking twice now about getting forward so much down the right-hand side. Hazard. Now Costa. Mikel.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
810;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1528;1560; The kelp. John Terry, and they've worked it nicely here, Chelsea, and they've got options here, and Asbunna Queta might go himself. Well, he did do it, Tim Howard for the first time really called into action and made an important save there for Everton. Yeah, Kone needs to know what he's doing here. He hasn't got a clue where Asbunna Queta is. Takes John Stones to come across and save his mate there.;whisper-large;Highlight
811;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1558;1590; It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. It's a good one. Matic's looking to deliver it and Gareth Barry standing tall defensively for Everton. Yeah, they're still going to have to defend well, Everton, in a 2-0 up.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
812;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1588;1620; Everton that in a 2-0 up, Chelsea are going to throw everything at them. And it goes from Matic again, again it's Gareth Barry with the header. And then a really nice knockdown by Lukaku, and here's the pace of Kone. Everton floating forward, Romelu Lukaku, the target couldn't quite reach it first time, still not away for Chelsea. Lukaku, really good cross, well defended by John-Ovi Mikel. How important might that clearance turn out to be?;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
813;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1618;1650; Gareth Barry in the off-touch role, and the walk-out entree, Marriner stood literally a yard or two away, he gives the free kick and some respite to Chelsea. Another opportunity, though, for Everton. It was, it was, here we see the free kick from Gareth Barry, there's another chance for Everton on the break again. Just moments before that. And it's gone. And it's gone. And it's gone. And it's gone. Here we see the free kick from Gareth Barry. There's another chance for Everton on the break again. Just moments before that.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
814;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1648;1680; And it's Ivanovic. Costa. Hazard has been able to really stamp his authority on the match so far, it's been a problem for the footballer of the year in the early weeks of the season he's going to get the free kick here though for that lunging challenge by the emerton captain phil jagielka there's;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
815;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1678;1710; Yeah, he's got a foul for his team, you know, he's come over here on the right side, he's been out on the left, through the centre, trying to seek the ball, but just a little bit of a foul there, Jagielka, and they've gone to sleep. There's Ivanovic from the quick free kick, Galloway though, woke up quickly, and then Garraffari, not for the first time, gets in there to win it back for Everton, and here they come again with Naysmith, if he can beat Mikel to it, not this time. The real problem though here for Chelsea, Michael, in transition, when Everton start to break, they're finding so much space and so many opportunities. Yeah, and that's why we say first goals in...;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
816;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1708;1740; Yeah, and that's why we say first goals in games are so important, because it almost dictates the shape of the game, the way the game's going to pan out, and obviously Chelsea now need to play possession football, they need to penetrate Everton, stay in their half, camp in their half, and Everton can just hit them on a counter-attack with all this pace, so the game has taken shape. Saw the counter-attack very effectively at Southampton, didn't we, on BT Sport a few weeks ago, and it's a similar game here that's developing further. Here come Chelsea, now, Tadro looking to wriggle through, and John Stones...;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
817;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1738;1770; to wriggle through and John Stones did really well and then you see the confidence using through the England defender when the little Cruyff turn inside the penalty area and all of a sudden Everton are going the other way Well that's what he does, he doesn't panic, he places a football in centre half in the Rio mould and sets his team on attacks from the last third in the defensive third, it's wonderful to see There's Lukaku, now Barkley, so many players in this Everton team playing with so much confidence today. Barkley to Lukaku. Now Barry.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
818;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1768;1800; Al-Dari, McCarthy. We're going to get a little bit of frustration maybe there from Ivanovic.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
819;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1798;1830; A bit of frustration maybe there from Ivanovic. Steven Naismith won't mind too much, no two goals already. Yeah, and he was going nowhere, wasn't he? He was probably facing a little bit of trouble, may have had to go back to his goalkeeper, so he was probably delighted to build a little clip from Ivanovic. You look at Chelsea at the moment, last year they were very hard to play against. You didn't want to play against them. They had pressure, they were physical. I think this difference this season is opposition have got time on the ball. I mean that's what they were good at, that it's there. Just as people were arriving on the ball they were closing.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
820;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1828;1860; on the ball they were closing. They haven't done that this season and they're paying the price for it. They've given too much time and space to things. It's a good ball out to Diego Costa, he's onside although pretty much alone in the field.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
821;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1858;1890; pretty much alone in the final third, but Chelsea was well dealt with by Coleman. Here's Asturrlaqueta, Diego Costa not much in the middle though from a Chelsea standpoint. Petro was looking to fill the void that Stones was out there quickly to him. Adolfo gives it away, Petrovic for Chelsea. Now Hazard, Ivanovic starts to make his way forward from full-back.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
822;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1888;1920; make his way forward from full-back, Favregas. Here is Ivanovic, Cesc Favregas, Lemanja Matic, and Mikel Costa. It's full of quickness coming to join in. Costa needs him in the end. And Mikel, And Costa needs him in the end. And Mikel, looking to put on a lot of bodies though between Chelsea and Tim Howard's goal. Rui Vanerwijk.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
823;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1918;1950; And the block comes in from Naismith and that's a Chelsea corner. So Kurt Zouma, who should have gone to join John Terry in the penalty area for the corner if Alević was the target. Kone with the header, now Petro.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
824;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1948;1980; Hazard, placed here by Coleman, John Terry, or Matic, can't find a way through Chelsea. Costa, Costa with the delivery when really you want Diego Costa on the end of crosses like that. Yeah, McCarthy and Barry are doing a very good job, just in front of the centre-arves, making it very difficult for Chelsea, who want to go through the middle at the moment as well, making it easy for Everton to defend, but they've got to break on them quickly, as they have been.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
825;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1978;2010; break on them quickly as they have been. There's Barclay and now there's a bit of room here for Seamus Coleman. And Barclay. And it goes towards Kone and Lukaku away by Terry but Evertson will get the possession straight back again Barkley;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
826;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2008;2040; Barkley. Well said nicely here out to Seamus Coleman, As-Bilicueta comes out defensively for Chelsea. Here's Aruna Kona, who's got support from McCarthy and from Coleman. Here is McCarthy, and the block there by As-Bilicueta, one or two appeals there for handball. The arm was certainly raised by the Spanish international. Antoine Marin are happy to allow the game to continue. And they've kept it in there through Gareth Barry-Everton. Here's Kone.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
827;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2038;2070; is Kone, a little clip in towards Lukaku and then on towards Nathan, he's on a hat-trick of course the look on Michael's face suggests he's not too convinced about that being a freaking Chelsea player. He's not keen on that at all and Vanovic he's got a reputation for going down too easy, he was lucky there because one day a referee won't buy it and no- another time could have picked the ball up and gone on the attack.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
828;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2068;2100; Petro's back on the right side now having had a go on the left against Coleman for a while. He's back out here against Brendan Galloway.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
829;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2098;2130; Here's Ivanovic, Pedro, Mikel, Matic, Matic is going to try his luck here and he hits an absolute beauty! What a strike from Matic! And Chelsea back in it. Wow, it's a thunderbolt from Matic. As soon as he left this foot, it was arrowing into that top corner. And that gets them back in it. It's a simple throw in. They're not much better than that.;whisper-large;Highlight
830;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2128;2160; Simple throw in, not much pressure on the ball but it's 30-35 yards out and he hits it so well. You can just see the flight of the ball, it's hardly spinning or anything, it's just purely struck from Matic. Thumping finish. He doesn't score many, does he the man in Matic? He got one last season here in the 6-3 win that Chelsea had against Everton but you don't hit them any better than that, Clint. It's a wonderful strike and you pay the price if you don't hit them any better than that, Glenn.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
831;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2158;2190; and at this level, at this quality, he paid the price. The character shown by Chelsea, nine minutes before half-time, and the goal that does change the complexion of this game, a game that was looking so easy for Everton. Zagielka's header above Costa, and the free-kick will go Everton's way.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

833;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2218;2250; Of course, you make the comparison a lot, don't we, between Manchester City and Chelsea. As Costa comes forward, people were expecting those two to battle for the Championship, City yet to concede a goal in the Premier League so far. Here's Hazard. Hazard's going to shoot, the deflection almost took it beyond Howard. It was a real battle while that shot was being sent in towards Howard's goal between Kostor and Jackie Elker as well just outside the penalty area. As we've said the top four players have fought at the top.;whisper-large;Highlight
834;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2248;2280; the top four players that fall at the top there will rotate in, will get implanted the ball, they're never out of this game Chelsea, there's no doubt about that, great run from Fabregas really to make the space for Hazard. Here's the Fabregas corner which is in towards Zouma, away by Kone. It's not been a goal threat so far, Costa, but he's certainly been a physical threat hasn't he, trying to use his size and bulk to disrupt these Edmonton defenders, Michael. Yeah, but that's what he offers, isn't it? Hazard has got a bit of freedom from the corner as well. McCarthy with the initial challenge.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
835;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2278;2310; McCarthy with the initial challenge, in towards John Terry! We've got plenty of power on the header but not quite the direction.

One back by Fabregas, here's Ivanovic, Matic, and they know he can hit them from here, and he's going to try it again. Now why not? Gareth Barry with the block, corner to Chelsea.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
839;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2398;2430; corner to Chelsea. Yeah, if only Gareth Barry or somebody else had made that block in the first goal. It was a similar area, wasn't it? 30, 35 yards out, and he just took aim. Another two obvious threats. No defender scored more goals than him in the Premier League era, John Terry. And it goes, Kono through at the up-tick time, winning the header from the corner.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

Now Mikel, Fabregas, Costa, Costa's going to strike one in the game, the block came in this time from Stones, which took it away from Howard's goal Yeah, great play from Stones there, because you wouldn't have been able to see much of this ball;whisper-large;Highlight
842;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2488;2520; You can see much of this ball, Costa just takes on his back leg and then cuts across his front. Always important not to get too close to the centre forward in that instance, make sure you can see the ball, get the block on. Chelsea, they're always a danger from the set-piece, and it goes from Fabregas, and this time it was Zouma attacking it, the last touch off Jagielka.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
843;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2518;2550; I know this time by stones as far as hazard who lines it up the final touch of think came off the van admits the deflection Andre Baron has given the goal kick to Everton but he could have gone anywhere that yeah when you hit it hard and low with that type of power. He's always got a chance of taking a deflection. One thought in his mind, he had to go for it.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
844;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2548;2580; One thought in his mind then as he walked onto it. Yeah, he steadied himself really well and you feel the pressure's just building up on Everton. Half-time's going to be a good half-time for them. Didn't think we'd be saying that midway through the half, that half-time can't really come soon enough for Roberto Martinez at the moment, but that goal from Matijs has changed things a fair bit. from Matijs, that changed things a fair bit.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
845;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2578;2610; McCarthy, now Barry. We've seen the calmness of Stones, there's the distribution that didn't quite get Galloway away. Really good perseverance though, isn't it, from the young left back of Everton. perseverance though isn't it from the young left back of Everton. Although he's got to get back into his defensive position now as Fabregas threads it through and the flag would have been up against Diego Costa.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

Yeah, Costa just starting to make those runs in behind now, getting in between the two centre halves, looking to go in behind rather than to feed, and it's a danger. Here's Coleman. Well, Barry. Clips on up towards Kone. So a busy weekend as always after the Champions League in Europa League, Fletcher and Sav were back next Saturday.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

Now Hazard, Pedro. Pedro with the shot, again it took, well I thought it took a deflection. It's gonna be a goal kick. You see Matic now just starting to get involved a little bit more with Hazard, with Pedro. Just a little bit off balance there.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

It was in his final season at Real Madrid and he went on that season to finish 15 points behind Barcelona.

851;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;28;60; This ball forward in the second half by Mikel, which is away by Seamus Coleman. And it's Aruna Kone, Matic win with a challenge for Chelsea. It's a case of Chelsea possession in the first half and Everton being very effective on the counter-attack Michael particularly for the first half an hour or so. I wonder what the respective managers might have done at half time just to check.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
852;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;58;90; might have done at half-time just to change things in their favour? Well, I think, like I mentioned in the first half, it could have been a totally different conversation at half-time hadn't the Matic goal gone in, and then Chelsea put Everton under a lot of pressure at the last part of that first half, so I don't think they'll be changing too much, more of the same, I'd say, from Jose Mourinho, and obviously from Roberto Martínez as he just needs to get back to how they were doing in the first part of the game. It's not easy when you've got so many top players like Chelsea have to stem that tide.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
853;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;88;120; have to stand that tide. I just felt Chelsea were too far in the centre of the pitch. Hazard came in, Pedro and Fabregas, all three of them were playing too tight. Now they've spread a little bit and the movement's become much better for Chelsea. There's Hazard who was more influential towards the end of the first half. Now Fabregas in towards Diego Costa, away by McCarthy this time. Here's Ivanovic.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
854;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;118;150; Matic, Matic's first Chelsea goal came on this ground last season, and scored one to remember in the first half here today. There's Darriyih with a challenge on Hazard, he's done that well today, Gareth Barrett. This is 567th appearance in the Premier League today.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
855;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;148;180; in the Premier League today Gareth Barry and Roberto Martinez will be pleased with what he's seen from his midfielder so far. Normally Ryan Giggs, Frank Manfield and David James have played more games in the top flight than Gareth Barry and he's been strong today. Yes, he's closed down exceedingly well and what he does is he closes when people are receiving the ball. Whilst he's still got the energy, as people are receiving it, he's actually down there throwing, getting the heads down, and he's pinched the ball for Everton today. Can he continue it for 90 minutes?;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
856;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;178;210; Little instance off the ball again there, Michael, with Diego Costa, he's not been a stranger to those today. No, well, there was a flailing arm, wasn't there, in the first half, on Coleman, and then there was definitely a little kick-out again there on Naismith, so it's that type of play, he sails close to the wind, doesn't he, and you'd say that he's one of the bankers to get a yellow card. It's Lukaku, Matic was tracking back, but he's so strong isn't he Moukaku when he's on the ball and they're begging the Test to hurry here, because McCarthy was applying the pressure;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
857;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;208;240; the pressure. Made those two really important saves didn't he Begovic in the first half when Everton really had their tails up they might be very significant for Chelsea today. Here's Seamus Coleman. McKellen with the challenge but Coleman didn't give it up for Emerton. McCarthy to Naysmith. Naysmith shoots towards Lukaku just reached there by Zouma and then Fabregas just caught by Naysmith as he played it away and that's being brought back for a Chelsea free kick;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
858;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;238;270; kick. Yeah just catches him there's Fabregas looking to to feed Costa earlier, gone early, just caught him though as a foul for Chelsea but they've given the ball away again needlessly. A challenge by Zouba on Lukaku, here's Matic. Hazard, Costa.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
859;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;268;300; and Hazard again but nobody to really pick out at this stage which allowed McCarthy to make the challenge Of course his seasons gone by Glenn you'd like to see you centre-forward leaving a bit on the defenders and all that kind of thing but he's frowned upon these days Diego Costa in days gone by would have been a dream wouldn't he for the managers.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
860;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;298;330; But I think he does it too late as well. I mean whilst there's a challenge to be done Ok, you can understand that but I think he does it in between play he gets himself all ragged and he's got to keep a cool head He's got to be fat thinking about getting goals. Can't do it these days 10 corners for Chelsea This one delivered by Fabregas and delivered a long way away by Jackie Elkett.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
861;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;328;360; and it falls here for Zouma and the block made there by Jackie Elka and Zouma again seems to use his arm which the Everton supporters appealed for the officials didn't agree and it's a start for the second half of the season and the second half of the season and the second half of the season and the second half of the season and the second half of the season and the second half of the season and the second half of the season Zouma again seems to use his arm which the Everton supporters appealed for, the officials didn't agree. And it's a straight down here Zouma as well and Hazard will come in.;whisper-large;Highlight
862;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;358;390; Zouma as well and Hazard will kick it out of play so his team-mate can get some attention. Looks like the right knee, Michael, doesn't it? Yeah, not good, does it? Someone goes down holding the knee. Let's just hope it was a bang and not a twist because... One of the dangerous ones. Looks as if it was a clash of knees or... of the dangerous ones, looks as if it was a clash of knees or... It's Barry again though, Gareth Barry again putting in challenges all day long for his team and that's the job he's got to do today. I think he's just a;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
863;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;388;420; job he's got to do today. It's just a clash of knees, I don't think there's anything twisted. He would be the replacement if there is anything wrong with Kurt Zouma that means he can't carry on. Gary Cahill who is away on England duty. Would that have been a difficult decision for Jose Mourinho today, Glen, who his centre-backs would be with John Terry free from suspension? Possibly, yes. I think he's gone for the strength strength I think he knows here at Goodison it's gonna be a tough game Lukaku strength and he went for zoom and he's nursing zoomer into his team;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
864;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;418;450; He's played him in midfield at times in different positions, but I think he sees him as a centre-half long-term. He's become a dad this week, which is why he wasn't part of the French squad for the international break, so it's been a happy week off the pitch for the young French international. And he's back on the field here at Goodison Park as well. For Chelsea.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
865;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;448;480; There's Pedro. Just a spin away here from Seamus Coleman, he's got that low centre of gravity and fantastic balance, Pedro. Couldn't quite link up this time though with Fabregas and Coleman can bring it away for Everton. Naismith towards Romelu Lukaku, it was a good idea from Nate Smith. Always got that option, having you to put the ball in behind the Chelsea defence and allow Lukaku to run onto it. Yeah, he works the channels quite well.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
866;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;478;510; Yeah, he works the channels quite well, does Lukaku. Obviously he's a big man, you need him in and around the box, Lincoln play, but he can make a good run into a channel. Here's Lukaku again. Gets just slightly quicker than McCarthy to it. Chelsea have only lost successive Premier League games once under Jose Mourinho, it came way back in May 2006.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
867;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;508;540; it came way back in May 2006 against Blackburn in Newcastle and by then they already wrapped up the championship that year. So when something's on the line, they don't tend to lose back-to-back games in the Premier League, but they're losing here today on the back of the defeat against Crystal Palace before the international break. That's Sir Kennedy preparing to come on for Chelsea, the Brazilian player getting the final words and instructions from his manager. In the meantime, here's Coleman for Amitie. Loves to burst forward.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
868;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;538;570; Loves to burst forward down this right-hand side, John Terry across for Chelsea. His challenge leads to an Edmonton corner. Positive play from Coleman, getting at John Terry, he's thinking about taking it on the outside, but good defending. He's holding him off, stays on his feet until he needs to go on ground and make the tackle experience showing there. Barclays out here to take the corner this time for Everton. Sent Jackie Elker into the box for Stones as well, Stones is the target.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
869;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;568;600; Well, Stones is the target. Stones has had it over the top of the bar. I know a lot was made about where John Stones might end up at the end of the January transfer window, but Paris Saint-Germain and Bayern Munich, the two clubs who were linked with Seamus Coleman, and he's another player that Roberto Martinez is very happy to have here at Goodison Park. So here's the change, and it's an attacking change isn't it from Mourinho. John-Ovi Mikhailov and Kennedy on Glenn. Yeah, you felt always chasing the game as they are at the moment.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
870;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;598;630; chasing the game as they are at moment to one that there was going to be more of an offensive look to Chelsea at some stage in the second half and Favre Gas will slide in that deeper role and Kennedy's come out here on the left hand side so it's slightly personnel change I don't think the shape will change they'll have that rotation that they've been doing ever so well all afternoon it's just a matter of time can they just open Everton up and get that equaliser.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
871;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;628;660; before the international break and he's quickly into the action here. Mourinho will hope he can have the same kind of success that the likes of Oscar and Willian have had, Brazilian players at Stamford Bridge. There's Fabregas. Slightly lower tempo though, isn't there, about the game in this second half? It was slightly pacier and maybe a little bit more direct in the first. More cagey since the restart;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
872;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;658;690; FANS SHOUT OUT Gets away from Kennedy, here's some McCarthy. Phil Jackie Elka, the Ederson captain. Galloway. If you look from Barty, just to see how much time he'd got Still going here Ross Bartley good feet from the youngster and then Matichu does do that;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
873;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;688;720; who does do that job so well just outside his own penalty area able to use those long legs to win it back for Chelsea. He's raced with him with a challenge on Tetraudio and the result is a Chelsea throw. Good feet from Young-Barclay there, almost like a slalom wasn't it the way he's gone by Chelsea defenders there. Look, beautiful foot back, Matics doing what he's very good at, in and around that penalty area and then distributing it from there.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
874;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;718;750; It's been forward towards Lukaku, good positioning there from Terry. Lots of ball as well with his left foot, hard volley from John Terry. Really good on the ball. He's had the Elcas challenge on Costa, it's been a good groundless for Chelsea.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
875;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;748;780; It's been a good fixture as well, they've won five of the last six meetings between the sides of Chelsea. Lukaku looking to extend the lead here, and he's in here Lukaku! Straight to Begovic, and then a little bit of a mix-up between goalkeeper and centre-back, and the appeal from the back-pass too, and you can understand why the crowd and why the Edmonton players thought the free-kick should have gone there. Absolutely Darren, absolutely, that's got to be a back pass. John Terry just ran a get out the way for the goalkeeper and then just tapped it back to him as we see. He just touches it back to him and he picks it up.;whisper-large;Highlight
876;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;778;810; He just touches it back to him and he picks it up. He's waiting for Bagavic to come and smother the situation. Good run again from Lukaku, hits it hard and low, but look at this now. And he toes it back into his hands. It's a mistake, what I feel, from the referee. It doesn't say anything in the rulebook about the distance of a pass back. That's a pass back and it should be a free kick to Everton now, but John Terry knows exactly what he's doing. It's a dangerous position for them and his wily experience comes into play there. Got away with it though.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
877;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;808;840; got away with it though. And we'll try and get Halen Webster on that when we get the opportunity. It did seem pretty straightforward for Andre Mane. Here's Ivanovic. Galloway goes across. Ivanovic still manages to squeeze it in towards Evan Hazard and then away by Jagielki, seems to be enjoying that physical battle with Costa today.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
878;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;838;870; Costner today. Here's Kennedy. Here's Kennedy.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
879;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;868;900; a relatively straightforward decision for Andre Marr in a back pass, wasn't it? I'd agree with you, Fletch, the only thing that Andre Mane has got to decide is a deliberate action. I've looked at it, he's got a clear view on it, unless he thinks he's just hit John Terry, but you can see there's a clear movement by John Terry's right toe towards the ball, which goes to Courtois, it's a back pass. Thanks, Howard. That clears that up. That won't please the Everton supporters, though, even though Howard's turned it up for us. They still lead 2-1, though, that will please them at this stage, and it's not the end.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
880;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;898;930; Will please them at this stage and it's not been the Chelsea onslaught at the start of this second half, Michael, that it might have been, they finished the first half pretty strongly, but they've not been able to pick up where they left off so far. No, not yet, still a long way to go, half an hour and that man's still got a couple of substitutions up his sleeve, hasn't he, if he needs it, so... I'm sure he'll throw a little bit more caution to the wind as the game progresses. One of two new faces on the Everton bench, Aaron Lennon.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
881;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;928;960; the Everton bench, Aaron Lennon on there, and the Argentine, Romero, Fulis-Mori as well, and Gerard de la Fe, of course, who joined in the summer. A slightly deeper squad for Roberto Martinez to pick on following the closing of the transfer window. We'll be targeting the top six again this season as well, though he needs some significant improvement from his team to get it. 72 points in 2014, became 47 last season. Here's Lukaku. Terry over there and Lukaku.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
882;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;958;990; Terry over there and Okaki from an extremely tight angle chanced his arm Well I can't believe he was having a shot there, I think he just missed it across but as Bilicueta gets drawn out, leaves that channel which really exposes John Terry he doesn't want his full-backs to go too far forward means he has to make the run and follow centre-forward into the channel;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
883;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;988;1020; and then Tendro was trying to slip it through towards Hazard and here's the amateur counter-attack that was so effective in the first half led by Ross Barkley. Now Kono for some reason had stopped the ball, but he's got the ball, he's got the ball, he's got the ball, he's got the ball, he's got the ball, he's got the ball, he's got the ball, he's got the ball, he's got the ball, he's got the ball, he's got the ball, he it through towards Hazard and here's the amateur counter-attack that was so effective in the first half led by Ross Barkley Okono for some reason had stopped running;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
884;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1018;1050; I think he wanted it earlier from Ross Barkley, pulled away square, showing him the space where he wanted to play and I think the young lad Ross just probably overplayed just a slight second. He thought he was going to veer offside I think, Kone. That looked a strange one to me because I thought Zouma's position was a little bit strange. Obviously the ball from Barkley was quite weak and he got away with it.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
885;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1048;1080; Away by Fabregas, here's Barry, and Barkley, what can he do this time? Fabregas with him, Lukaku, now McCarthy, Steven Maysmith, now Kone gets on the ball, he's got a Vannevic over there with him, and he's going to try one himself. Straight from the big figure of Asmir Begovic in the Chelsea goal. He looks to set Hazard away quickly, although Jagielka across and then Barry Alonso.;whisper-large;Highlight
886;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1078;1110; Barry alive to things again. Just wanted to gasp in the crowd when McCarthy played the ball there. I think the biggest gasp came from McCarthy as well. Here's Kona. Now Barkley. So long as Brian Matic, Barkley went down, Kona is trying to win it back here for Everton, and in the end they get away with it there.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
887;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1108;1140; and in the end they get away with it there Chelsea, and now Petro can wriggle away. Hazard, Andre Marriner plays the advantage, Galloway it was who was late in the challenge. Here's Fabregas, now Costa. That's still Equator. And it goes towards Hazard, and Timell took matters into his own hands and that would be a Chelsea corner.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
888;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1138;1170; Yeah, expect the referee to bring play back a little bit here, maybe show the yellow card. Yeah, good refereeing from Andre Mane. Two-gallon range, fantastic, yeah. Good the way that play go on. It was a bad tackle on Padraigl, actually. Late and fully deserves a yellow card. Wonderful break from Chelsea though, great bit of football.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
889;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1168;1200; great bit of football from one end to the other, four or five passes in there in behind and attacking Everton First yellow card in the game there shown by Andre Marriner for Brendan Galloway In goes the corner towards Tedrow No touch there from Mays Smith and the free kick to Everton I think even Treggsreau real realizes he wasn't going to get that one. Yeah, he went down.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
890;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1198;1230; He went down quite easily didn't he? Here we see the yellow card on Pedro a minute ago, he just gets a toe in and it's never going to hurt Pedro like that but obviously he went to ground and you can't do that. Here's Barkley. Aaron Lennon preparing himself to come on for Everton. Lennon who was effective on loan from Spurs towards the end of last season, signed on a tournament.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
891;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1228;1260; end of last season signed on a terminate transfer on deadline day fabric ass up towards Kennedy the teenagers done well there for Chelsea now Costa if Manovich That one's out.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
892;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1258;1290; I think Mourinho looking there pensive would be a little bit disappointed that Chelsea haven't covered Everton's goal. You know coming in they finished the half really well, they played decent football in midfield but they haven't really created those chances that they look like they were going to do at the back end of the first half. There's Kono.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
893;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1288;1320; There's Koenig, he's got a room to turn in the midfield, and now Nate Smith. And Valovic's committed himself, he got the ball, and then Koenig was helping out too, although that... Nate Smith was determined, and that determination's run inside the corner. Yeah, it's great, isn't it, a few tackles going in, the crowd are getting up for this, nice little knock-knock pass there from Koenig to Nate Smith, misses, almost a scissor action, wasn't the two foot scissor action the fans didn't quite like there but the benefit starting his 60th successful;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
894;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1318;1350; It's starting his 60th successive Premier League match today right back for Chelsea. An interesting start to the season, hasn't even served. Here's the corner from Barkley away by Costa. Now Barry, Matics was behind him and Andre Marriner allows the game to carry on. Galloway for Everton, now Naismith, Lukaku, Askele Kekul, the defender, another good save from Begovic, and then Lukaku onto it again, and Askele Kekul...;whisper-large;Highlight
895;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1348;1380; and Askele Kroos in the right place to stab it behind his mate. Three important saves, Begumic. Yeah, terrific save, great first-time ball from Weismith. Has a go, cross to goalkeeper. But he makes sure it doesn't go from his body into the danger zone. Comes back out wide again, gives the defender a chance to defend it. Stones and Jackie Elker have gone forward, it's in towards Stones, away by Terry. McCarthy was looking to play it back out towards Barclay, and then left Kennedy's ball, lacking the necessary accuracy.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
896;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1378;1410; Lacking the necessary accuracy, and it should give both managers the opportunity to make changes if they want to do it now. There's Aaron Lennon and Radamel Falcao that will be sent on by Jose Mourinho. Falcao who is often running in terms of scoring goals, got the goal against Crystal Palace, albeit in a losing effort. There's some space for Kona who gives it Barkley.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
897;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1408;1440; and Legsman, Galloway, touch came off the Chelsea man, Everton corner better spell for Everton now, with a little bit of ball in Chelsea's half they're obviously going to look to bring Lennon on and use his pace and his wit So there you get the Chelsea change;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
898;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1438;1470; So the Chelsea changes, Petro replaced by Falcao. It's a real positive move by Mourinho, he doesn't normally look to play those two strikers together, but he needs the goal, doesn't he? So it's probably the right thing to do, but they've got to defend it well as a team also. Barty gets it back here from Baric. as a team also.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
899;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1468;1500; and Kennedy could play the ball away. Here's Hazard, leaps up to Falcao and then they're stringing forward here, Chelsea was an excellent ball from Falcao to Bramislav Ivanovic. Hazard wanted it, Costa gets it, here's Diego Costa, away from the challenge of McCarthy and then into Phil Jacquelka. And a really important challenge by Everton's captain, just a lick of time. Yeah, but from the Chelsea point of view, you're looking at it thinking, how have they got a shot away here? You think Ivanovic is going to shoot, and he decides not to.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
900;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1498;1530; and he decides not to, at the far end there's a ball in there, they decide not to play and then you see, Kostas onside, expecting him to get a shot off though. There's Fabregas, Fabregas towards the back post where there was nobody, it was too deep the cross, now Terry Hazard. Ivanovic's looking to roll away from Barkley and no free kick according to Andre Mourinho. Is that the kind of position last season? Glen Red Costa might want to take the first time when he was confident. He wouldn't have even had a second thought, would he? Inside the right foot, going...;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
901;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1528;1560; inside the right foot going across the goalkeeper. That's what I've been looking to have done. Here's Lukaku on the move, still Lukaku, he's got Kone up with him, but he couldn't quite pick him out with the cross. It's not the first time in the match is it where Lukaku's found himself in that kind of position for Everton today? No, and he does the hard work, obviously uses his strength, gets into a decent position, but this should be hard really you know it's a it's a poor ball, it's a miss it ball, you only have to either hit it, it's almost like a pass either hit it hard low across or ding it;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
902;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1558;1590; or dink it to the back post but neither really it's an opportunity wasted And number 12, Aaron Levin!;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
903;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1588;1620; under Roberto Martinez seems to have been around for so long he got into the first team at Leeds at 16, he's only 28 Aaron Lennon you think he's much older yes he's certainly got a lot of game time under his belt for an eight-year-old but got his pace now and I think the fact that Chelsea are gonna have to throw bodies forward playing with two strikers up there there's gonna be big open spaces for Lennon maybe to;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
904;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;1618;1650; It's interesting the fact that Mourinho's playing with the two strikers, Radamel Falcao and Diego Costa. They got 54 goals between them at Atletico Madrid in the 2012-2013 season. Falcao got 34 of those. They were very effective as a pair in Spain. Whether they'll be as effective these days post knee injury for Falcao in the Premier League then remains to be seen. I think that's the key, the knee injury. That was before the knee injury.

I'm sure Glenn's going to talk glowingly about John Stones in a second. There's Coleman. Quite den-bound enough, it was all about the beginning of that move for you, Glenn. Just fantastic to see a young English centre-back playing like that under pressure.

And for me, as an international manager, you're looking for players like that. That's where they concede space. Teams in the Euros coming up in the summer, they'll give us space at the back, and those players like John Stones, if you've got somebody that can use the ball like that, it's a massive bonus to get your key players on the ball in midfield.

This is a real key moment for Everton in the game, what with 78 minutes they've made a few changes, why the new centre-half coming in, he's not going to be used to playing with Jagielka or anyone else and now John Stones is going to run it back. He substitutes on Lennon now from Set Blaze and I think this is a real key time for Everton to stick in there.

He's only really picked the ball out the back of the net once and that's about it. So Everton defend them really well despite the pressure. Julian's corner this time. It's gone out before it came back in again. So a wasted opportunity for Chelsea and a goal kick that will bring some respite for Everton. I think on the back of that as well, I think Lukaku has got to play a big part. When your team's defending like this, respite for Everton.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

Everton get the week off after this before they go to Swansea next weekend, but Mekabi Tel Aviv come to Stamford Bridge on Wednesday for Chelsea and then they've got the small matter of Arsenal Another game you'll see on BT Sport next Saturday and then the League Cup against Walsall It's a really important month ahead of us;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

If you're going to come far out, you've got to get low, make sure someone's going to go over the top, but Naismith does all he can, hits it hard and low, and he's the hat-trick hero of the day. Well, if you would have said to Steven Naismith this morning, what do you want for your 29th birthday on Monday? You might want to set a hat-trick against Chelsea and that's what he's got. His first hat-trick in an Everton shirt and that might well see Liglen. When he took his seat on the bench at the start of the game, I don't think anyone else did.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

Yeah, definitely, I was in the Chelsea camp before the season started, thought, oh, we're going to muscle the way to another title, but, as you mentioned, 11 points, don't care what time of the season, 11 points is a long, long way back.

Half a chance, though, wasn't it, for Valcao? More than half a chance, especially for him, who's so good in the hat. Just pulling back onto that back post, perfect little ball in from Hazard. I'm expecting him to do a lot better than that, but look at that way. If they do go on to lose this match, Chelsea, it will be their worst start to a league season since they were a second-division side under Bobby Campbell back in 1988.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

Just how significant from that statistic the hat-trick is for Steven Nesbitt, who's then fouled by Williard, and he brings a free kick to Everton.

Yeah, they've had some brilliant performances all over the pitch, seeing Young Galloway there making another good tackle, this lad on the ball has been sensational today, and a hat-trick arrow, there's been so many good performances, it's been a really good game.

Last year they were very effective doing that. From an Everton standpoint, Michael, what a building block this is for them to kick on from here. Yeah, they needed this, didn't they? I think it was five points before today in the first four games, but just to get that win rockets you right up into the top few in the league table big boost of confidence especially coming back from international duty and you can have a real run for it now;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
944;england_epl;2015-09-12 - 14-45 Everton 3 - 1 Chelsea;2818;2850; and have a real run for it now. I think Funes Moris been watching the John Stones videos, the way he brought that forward from the back, and then he was unceremoniously dumped over by Diego Costa, who gets what's seemingly the obligatory yellow card. Well, looking at it, that's what Roberto wants from his defenders, if he's going to build up from the back. Look at the confidence he's got here, and the pressure. No, I'm going to burst into midfield, hold him off and he draws the foul. That's great, that's great attacking defensive play.

It would be interesting to see if Swansea persist with their usual passing game. Chelsea did the same thing a few weeks ago and ran out.

Looking at Swansea's shape at the moment, it's Shelby who is sat alongside Jack Cork, he has moved out to the far side. Shallon playing a little bit deeper here.

A couple of mistakes by Rocco, putting Manchester United under pressure, Swansea nearly making them pay. Fairly straightforward corner routine, decent ball into just beyond the near post, great header from Baphite Magomasson, a good goal line clearance, the linesman on the far side didn't flick it.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

Nothing special about the delivery, it's good, but look at the time and space that Gomes has got to power that header towards the far side netting. And it's a ball that just started to cross the line, but didn't cross the line. Confirms from Herrera, that's what he's there for.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

Well he's still yet to fully convince his manager Louis van Gaal and Herrera but he's certainly convinced that Manchester United fans of his talent. Not so much clearing off the line but at the other end he always tends to do something in a game.

It was a shadow handball by Di Maria. I think that was out of desperation as much as anything he knows he should have done better there. Lovely ball from midfield to release him. And as you spotted, terrific movement from the two strikers. Di Maria would be disappointed not to have found one of them. Demarie would be disappointed not to have found one of them.

Shelby putting the squeeze on McNair. His third start in the right-back position Paddy Manero, who did arrive at Manchester United as an attacking midfielder as a youngster. Saw him play right back against Liverpool's under-21s a couple of weeks ago, he was excellent, scored a brilliant goal. Louis van Gaal reckons he could be United's right back for the next 10 years.

Gomez finding Taylor, Rallidge, time to spin, get the shot away! He was straight at the hair. It's another good chance. Ravage trying to spin, get the shot away. He was straight at the hair.

Here it's another good run to take him across the front of his man. He just doesn't get the power on the strike. Well Tim Sherwood promised effort, energy and goals at Villa Park. He's repaying us as good as he's worried. Yeah, second phase from the corner, they don't deal with it. Fabian Delph delivers a wonderful cross.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

1572;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1798;1830; They've got bodies in there, Key's got across the front of his man, it's a ball into a great area, but Manchester United have got to defend better than that. Give Shelby credit, lovely ball in, great run from Key in a smart finish, but the defender played a part in that. Well his first ever Swansea City goal came against Manchester United, that was at Old Trafford on the opening day and they are in his line of fire again.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1573;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1828;1860; 1 minute 56 seconds between both goals, that's how long Manchester United had the lead for. Well Swansea rarely fail to score here at home, and they've responded brilliantly. I was just about to say as Shelvey was drawing his foot back to throw that ball in there, you know how expensive were those two misses that can go miss early on deep but the backs who were;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1574;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1858;1890; on B but they're back to level pegging. Well you know Gary Munk had to do plenty of convincing to keep Key at Swansea City in the summer. He had a loan spell at Sunderland last season, a really successful time as well and Gus Pleyett wanted to take him permanently But he feels that this is his home and Gary Munk after lengthy discussions Persuaded him to stay here;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1575;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1888;1920; to stay here and he's been one of Swansea City's best performers this season. Yeah, it's amazing isn't it how you get players and managers and coaches that there's just something doesn't work between them and the same player comes back and is a success. I mean he's always been a good player, he was a record-signer I think for a brief period of 5.5 million so there's no doubt in his pedigree but just couldn't get in the team under the previous regime.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1576;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1918;1950; There's Raleigh, Swansea looking for more here. Now it's Cork. Robin van Persie. There goes Di Maria.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1577;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1948;1980; He's got three to pick out to his right. He's tried to find Paddy McNair who can't finish with his right foot. But he wasn't given a moment's tease by Rallage. There's McNair again. Well, another sweeping move again from Manchester United. Again, it's down the left. Terrific footwork on the halfway line from Van Persie to release Angel Di Maria. Well, another sweeping move again from Manchester United. Again, it's down the left.

1578;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;1978;2010; McNair but he just waited too long and allowed Routless to get back but as I say another fine move going forward from United. Nicely done by Herrera for Laney. Robin van Persie trying to bend that into the back of Fabianski's net. You can see exactly what he was trying to do. The lay-off was just a little bit too far away from him to enable him to wrap his left foot around it sufficiently to bring it inside the far post. He'll just want his equaliser again. Too easy for me.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1579;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;2008;2040; game too easy for me first of all for Shelby to get into that much time and space to put that ball in and for Key to get across into that the heart of the six yard box really to finish Angel Di Maria Fellaini closing in, too close to Fabianski down the street.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1580;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;2038;2070; Well this is the big day in Swansea City's calendar. This club which was so close to oblivion not that long ago, now rolling out the red carpet for Manchester United, standing as equals on their own pitch in South Wales.

1582;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;2098;2130; Now Rocco. Daniel De Maria has been heavily involved in this first half. Tresure. De Maria once more. He's managed to deliver the cross. that was a vital touch by Williams. Now Gomez, who on the whole, his hold of play is really good, it was during his time at Leeds.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1583;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;2128;2160; is really good it was during his time at Lyon and San Etienne. He's had his issues here because when he arrived he thought that Gary Munk would play two up front him and Bonny and that's the way Gary Munk did go in that preseason until their final game against Villarreal when they were ripped apart and Gary Munk decided that it would be better one up front again. And it's not the way Swansea have played at all, as they've got from obviously they've stuck with the 4-2-3-1 that they started the Premier League with, they're still sticking with it now.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1584;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;2158;2190; the Premier League with are still sticking with it now so maybe a bit unrealistic for Daffy Gormous to expect that. He's got his chance now though. Not his finest moment. There's Dele Bland. Now it's Rooney. There's Tally McNair.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1585;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;2188;2220; There's Paddy McNair. Fellaini. Now Blind. Shaw. Trying to outmanoeuvre Key. After Key did the same to him with that equalising goal. with that equalising goal. Good play from Shaw, and it's a good cutback as well. Unfortunately Van Persie had just left the space exactly where Luke Shaw put it.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

1587;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;2248;2280; Routledge seems to be pushed in the back here, the referee has seen it. Foul by Luke Shaw. Luke Shaw just caught the wrong side of his man. Ball just dropping. He's gambled hasn't he, Luke Shaw? He's taken a chance at the ball, he's not going to drop for Ratovic, he just does, and he's got to commit the foul.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1588;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;2278;2310; It's been better from Swansea City so far today, they were flat 10 days ago against West Bromwich Albion and paid the price. One win in seven games but they are seven points better off than they were a year ago. Still on course to achieve their best ever Premier League finish and points total. Previous best was 19.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

Rooney doesn't give that one away either. There's Van Persie. Di Maria driving at Norton. Now it's Robin Valle.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1590;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;2338;2370; Now it's Robin van Persie, survived the handball appeals. Strong shots as well. National room's incensed, we're not sure. Told you it was bound to happen. Charlie Austin has scored for QPR Andy. Another super header. Rick Cross in again though. He may be down to ten men, but there's still some fight there. Once the celebration look, it's a reference to the fact he failed the medical on his knee. Fat hole. One apiece.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1591;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;2368;2400; Some of those action rooms obviously had a very close-up view of that. Yeah, a bit of history between those two as well, isn't it? Julian Williams and Robin van Persie after a spot of bother here a couple of years ago. Good work again from Rooney. It was a difficult bounce in Bale, he had to gather it. Good first touch and then a nice simple layoff to keep possession for his team. He's had a terrific half, the captain.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1592;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;2398;2430; in terms of Rudy just get the feeling at the moment that this now is his team he is the main man before he's had that Robin van Persie that wonderful season he had when he first arrived at Old Trafford then the team being built around Cristiano Ronaldo, but Wayne Rooney is leading this team now. Patti McNair trying to lead United up the field but runs out of;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

He's not got that devastating burst of pace that Luke Shaw has to take him past his man. He just ran out of ideas and ran out of space. He could defend it from Shelby. He wasn't tempted in to try to tackle him. Just ran him down the line and out of space.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1594;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;2458;2490; Go and be spinning that header. That's Kyle Norton offside against Rallidge. the is that a bit;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1595;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;2488;2520; He is adamant that his players now understand his philosophy. It's taken seven months but they understand their roles in this team, the geometry of the whole pitch. Everything is planned to the finest detail. He used to have a motto framed on his office wall at Ajax which said, quality is the exclusion of coincidence. I'm still not sure they're not quite some way away from being at their best yet. We've seen numerous examples today where players have misunderstood each other, but they're getting there and it is very much a win.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1596;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;2518;2550; getting there and it is very much a work in progress. That Ajax team by the way were wonderful to watch. They pressed high, they were quick, dynamic. Quite been that way for Manchester United under Louis van Gaal as of yet. They are getting the job done.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1597;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;2548;2580; Now Shaw. Rooney, where's he going this time? Now short. Slightly been down that left-hand side that Manchester United have made inroads.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1598;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;2578;2610; The pace of Shaw and the confidence of Shaw of course because that's what he made his name as a really attacking fullback in combination really with Van Persie and Angel de Maria who drifted out into wide positions to help him on this near side McNair hasn't had the same help at all from Herrera or Fellaini. Rocco looking to lose Cork in the middle but again those crosses have been easy for Fabianski to grab a hold of.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1599;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;2608;2640; He is known as a very positive goalkeeper when it comes to taking crosses so he never needs a second invitation particularly when the ball is that close to him. Key's missed an opportunity there, there's a big switch of play onto Shelby, he's still out on the right-hand side but... Cork has gone through the middle and the door was slammed shut by Phil Jones.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1600;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;2638;2670; Swansea in a good position, losing possession. United then themselves in a good position but they too gave the ball back to Swansea who nearly released Gomez. So it's been that type of a game. Lots of mistakes. Fellaini again has brought himself to the attention of the referee who now brings up the yellow card and says that is the fourth time. Well the referee didn't think he was going to book him actually but in the end he got the yellow card.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1601;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;2668;2700; but in the end he put the other card out and put his arms out wide as if to say well what else can I do? Paul touched him for lane, he ball fired into him, ball bounces off him and then typically you know he's just clumsy and he's awkward and he's made contact with Cork, I'm not sure, I'm not absolutely sure it was a foul actually but he's all over Cork isn't he and Cork's taken the opportunities, felt the contact and gone down and as you say that's four free kicks the referee has warned him on the last one.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1602;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;2698;2730; has warned him on the last one. He's gone looking. Well we'll show you at half-time but Chelsea think they should have had a penalty at Stamford Bridge. Meanwhile Stoke have scored. And yet another header. Lovely cross in again. Right in the middle of goal. Jouf leaves Guzan helpless.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1603;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;-2;30; Clashing with him, the lights were turned out but Louis van Gaal is slowly switching them back on. Being back in the Champions League is a must. Van Gaal has to deliver a top four place this season. They're on course, they can't afford to slip because they'll see Southampton, Arsenal, Spurs and Liverpool all coming over the hill. 1-1 here at the break and Manchester United have brought on Antonio Valencia to replace Paddy McNair at half-time.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1604;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;28;60; time a straight swap right back that's Di Maria, Luke Shaw still ahead of Rooney now it's key there's Gomez putting himself around again round again. Good play by Blaine.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1605;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;58;90; Good play by Blind with Valencia pushed on there, there's a big hole to the right hand side of United's defence and that's what Daley Blind does of course, fills those holes and protects his back foot. A flag muffle straight, Baffet-Gomes again here. And I think Paddington there can consider himself a little unfortunate there because in that last move there we saw United, Luke Shaw has always got plenty of support and help available to him Paddington there was pretty much to his own devices down that right;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1606;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;88;120; pretty much to his own devices down that right-hand side. It's all part of the learning process for him. Valencia, hugely experienced of course, not necessarily as a right-back, an orthodox right-back in a four, certainly has played, bringing back many occasions. Marcus Rocco being forced off the pitch. Slight readjustment is needed. I think it's the colour of the tape, isn't it?;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1607;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;118;150; That's Rooney. You mentioned though it's still a learning curve for Paddy McNervis, this was only the third time, the third time in a senior game he'd started at right back. Absolutely. 19 years of age, you know, a few starts under his belt. He's going to have games like that when things just don't quite work out for him. A reminder, he did come to the club as an attacking midfielder. just don't quite work out for him.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1608;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;148;180; Rocco waiting to be waved back on the pitch. Now he's back on. And Svorbryk showing a yellow card. That's the reason why. And he's gone Phil Jones' way.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

1610;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;208;240; Sticking out a boot under pressure from Key and the enquiry, the post-mortem goes on into what exactly happened at the back there for Manchester United. Again, almost the exact spot on the other side of the pitch where Shelby threw the ball in for Key to equalise. And Key again has got himself free. Les and Luke Shaw who really should be picking him up. David Blins will absolutely furious with his defenders. It's a good area of the ball but you know how Swansea three, four times now have got people free right at the heart of the Manchester United defence.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1611;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;238;270; of the Manchester United defence is unforgivable really for a team as good as Manchester United. Well they had a wonderful start to the season defensively Manchester United but they have tightened up but Swansea City have found a routine a couple of times. There's Valencia now it's Marouane Fellaini.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1612;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;268;300; What actually looked like, I thought David Hare got his angles wrong or misread that ball going in there, but it actually turns out he's made a good save. Angel Di Maria with this corner kick, the change straight into the gloves of Fabianski. Everybody went near. And Angel Di Maria over hit the cross.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1613;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;298;330; Maria over hit the cross. That's my play.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1614;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;328;360; There's Van Persie. A confirmation that it appears it was Phil Jones who was yellow carded a few moments ago. Now it's Wayne Rooney who was terrific in the first half. Luke Shaw. Rooney. who was terrific in the first half.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1615;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;358;390; Probably for the first time in this game, as Patz didn't come off. It was about to start, the first time was at 1-2. One touch pass is that he's produced so many in the first half, didn't find its target. And Chesnow to have won just three times away from home in the Barclays Premier League this season.

1617;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;418;450; No panic from Manchester United, that might change now though, Sigurdsson unable to bring the ball under his spell. Well the intervention played away out, Manchester United great patience and great courage, took a mistake actually to release them. Well that kind of situation does take courage, confidence, trust from your teammates as well. That's the key word, trust, yep.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1618;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;448;480; Faced by Di Maria towards Valencia. So Phil Jones but, and that's why. I can't think of Phil Jones or Antonio Freekicks giving against him. There didn't seem to be too much in that, but if he was quick to get the car up, I don't think he would have won.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1619;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;478;510; He was quick to get the card up, made his mind up early. Yeah, not happy that he kicked the ball away. And it's Dele Blind. Now it's Fellaini. Herrera. Antonio Valencia. And it's a goal.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

1621;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;538;570; It didn't quite work as it was meant to. The last call that United had, everybody went near. And then with the Maria hit it low. And on that occasion we had bodies at the back of the penalty area. And he's hit it low to the near post. Well on Fellaini, he has jumped to the edge of the box. Ashley Williams is keeping a keen eye on them, there's a five-yard gap between them. Fellaini will have the run on Williams here. Rooney with the corner, much more uncomfortable for Fabianski that time.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1622;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;568;600; Comfortable for Fabianski that time, but Swansea City have got the job done. And it's Angel Di Maria. Seen off by Sigurdsson. Raulich, Gomez trying to hold his run. Keir set the ball through to Gomez, who wanted the ball in front of him. Lovely set-up play, potentially a fantastic counter-attack there. Good strength from Sigurdsson, nice set-up in midfield. Lovely set up play, potentially a fantastic counter attack there.

He said it came to his feet and the move was dead. He was compared to a young Didier Drogba when he first arrived on the scene at San Etienne. Baffet Gomez, power and presence. He must have had quite a few baron spells during his career. His only Premier League goal so far was a big goal here against Arsenal.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
1624;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Swansea 2 - 1 Manchester United;628;660; so far, it was a big goal here against Arsenal. I know but still not a fantastic goal scoring record he's got here at Swansea is it?

Missed cue from Shelby. It was Swansea's turn to get away with some poor defending. There was an instant there where Fellaini had been allowed to drift across into the middle of the field. Everyone had just backed off him and I thought it opened up up nicely from to have the shot. He didn't take that but the move eventually ended up with the cross going in.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

You can't say that Louis van Gaal isn't going for it. He's got two wingers as his two full backs, three attacking midfielders, one holding and two out and out strikers on the pitch at the moment.

He had two or three options on, and I think you're right, it might have been meant for Routledge, but it's straight at Gomez, he couldn't control it.

This time it's Liverpool's turn to appeal for a penalty. Well if Fond makes contact with the ball, that's the challenge of the highest order.

Yeah, you just saw that there and the problem they've got, Liverpool, the two are going to press and they've got to come up from behind and that's not happened.

And these situations that are not alien to football, of course, but that are alien to what is purely and strictly sports, they now force Chelsea to a degree of maximum attention because it has not closed the game in 70 minutes when he has been able to do it for his greater superiority and control of the match and now he is seeing himself as maintaining a minimum advantage but with 20 minutes;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

2032;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley;1648;1680; punished with red, which is what is incredible. We already mentioned it about Van Rees, he has been the most dangerous of the barli in terms of shots, with a great ability to see goal and also quickly as effective as possible because in complicated situations he has managed to direct two or three balls into the three sticks we are going to see there Terry clearing Felipe appeared he does not understand with Zouma and now the players of the bar and are the ones who claim;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

We will have to see that action again between Zouma and Philippe, between one and the other, the lack of understanding. And we will see what has happened there. At the moment, Kite Lee is missing. How will the game end? And a climate of nervousness is installed in the Stanford Bridge. Nervousness, a bit of revenge that there may be here.

2035;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley;1738;1770; the game for Chelsea while Trippier now looked for that long ball for Vans. We are with him, with the capacity he has had to finish off but a player who has gone to body to body but with also quite ugly details, very ugly. Because he has made unfair entrances, as it is usually said, because one thing is to go with force, go hard to the divided balls, even go strong, and another thing is to go with unfair gestures, and that's what I think Barnes has done in the end.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
2036;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley;1768;1800; and that's what I think that at some point and those unfair gestures have to be punished with yellow sale courtois who manages to clear outside the area driving headlong towards the line of the band that atmosphere of disconcerted has also been installed in stanford bridge the team now trying take the pulse and measure to a game that was clearly dominating in general lines and one thing in richard to pay if they are going to punish because in england that does work well take the pulse and measure to a game that was clearly dominating the general lines and one thing enrique to pay if they are going to punish because in England that does work well in England they have some;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

And these things are done on the job and I think with all the reason in the world, because even if the referee has not seen the gravity of the entry, it cannot be impugned. And in England it is entered on the job and Barnes can say goodbye to the competition, just as it happened to Diego Costa, maybe for three games, perfectly. We'll see, but I think there will be a safe sanction.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

Schindicke appreciates a more conservative character in Chelsea and let's see if he takes the opportunity to put more dust on top. more dust up? I think it's going to make the game even more simple. I suppose he's going to try with long balls to keep Chelsea behind and then look for the center of the field.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

He has fallen into a very bad position. Hazard, after the action of Trippier, holds well. William, who turns to Arfield, coming out well against Voit. The return of Diego Costa. Again, William, who is giving him the necessary pause that the team now needs.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

How attractive is Hazard. He was about to score the second for Chelsea. It's tremendous how Hazard attracts rivals. In this case, they get up to four to surround him. And then he can unload and leave his teammates in advantage. It's something that happens very often. Voulx enters.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
2044;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley;2008;2040; for Caipley. The Welshman Sam Vokes, a striker. I thought Juzkiewicz would come in here, who is a more physically powerful player. But well, Sam Vokes comes in. Let's see what Barley's idea is for this final stretch with only one goal of disadvantage and with numerical superiority, which is very interesting for this team. In Stamford Bridge, no less in the leader's house. Here in Premier, Manchester City have only scored.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight
2045;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley;2038;2070; only Manchester City have scored. Inks' opening towards me, Hazard comes to deviate, it will be a corner kick for Barley. And Tripper's shot has created problems for Chelsea so far. So in this type of action, I'm sure the right-back will go to the shot, and surely with that shot, with those balls so touched, it is generating danger to Chelsea. Well, Trippier at the launch.;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

It's impressive how easily he charges and arms his right leg. Keihil is going to enter. Defending from the top.

Well, no, because the header of me, the left side, of the player who usually stays covering.;whisper-large;Highlight

2049;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley;2158;2190; What a great shot from Ramires. In an action that will probably cost Ramires a talk with his coach. Because these are the kinds of actions in these situations that often define a footballer. Ramires has a lot of virtues, but in this case his pair has escaped him and he has scored an authentic header goal with another great ball from the stripper from that corner;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

The world the other way around because the weakest team in the air game during this current season the Premier, the team that has scored 16 goals in the first leg, but that couldn't defend that header from the left back Benmi.

2052;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley;2248;2280; He's got to do the second. I'll tell you something, Mourinho is regretting not having made the change to Cahill before. Because if there's a central, in addition to John Terry, who manages and who controls in the air football, it's Cahill. Let's see that ball from Arfield looking for Ings who ended up on the ground. The ball is brave and that must be praised to the team of Shin Ditch, which is not conformed with the tie to one in a stadium where only the city has been able to tie and that must be praised;whisper-large;Non-Highlight

When Drogba comes in, the team will surely look for him in the long run. He will look for second chances, he will surely charge the area a lot. Zouma cleared it. Let's see why no one came to that ball. Terry measures better than anyone else in the end. The ball's bounce. He's putting the danger away. It was Shaq. Voit. Voit.

2057;england_epl;2015-02-21 - 18-00 Chelsea 1 - 1 Burnley;2398;2430; direct. Keihil is the one that came to my head because I was thinking that Mourinho has surely regretted having put Keihil in before. Because he has scored a header goal, a goal that can be very valuable. Many things have happened in this game.
